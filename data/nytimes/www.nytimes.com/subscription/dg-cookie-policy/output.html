          This Cookie Policy explains how cookies and similar technologies (collectively,
          “<strong>Cookie(s)</strong>”) are used when you visit our Site.
          A “Site” includes our websites, emails, and other applications owned and operated by
          The New York Times Company (the “<strong>Company</strong>”, “our”, or “us”)
          as well as any other services that display this Cookie Policy.
          This policy explains what these technologies are and why they are used, as well as your
          right to control their use.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change this Cookie Policy at any time.  Please take a look at the “LAST REVISED”
          date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any change
          in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy
          available on or through the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any question, please contact us by email at
          <a href="mailto:privacy@nytimes.com">privacy@nytimes.com</a>, or write to us at the

          <h2>1. What Is A Cookie?</h2>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to a
            user’s browser from a website's computers and stored on a user’s computer's hard drive
            or on a tablet or mobile device (collectively, “<strong>Computer</strong>”). A Cookie stores a small
            amount of data on your Computer about your visit to the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar
            technologies on our Site to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or
            received a message. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although
            it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an email or other type
            of message, which is retrieved from a remote website on the internet enabling the
            verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A web
            beacon helps us to understand whether you came to our website from an online
            advertisement displayed on a third-party website, measure successes of email marketing
            campaigns and improve our website performance. They may also enable us to relate your
            viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including
            your personal information. In many instances, web beacons rely on cookies to function
            properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We place and access Cookies on your Computer; these Cookies are known as “first-party
            Cookies.” Cookies may also be placed and accessed by some of our third-party vendors,
            which are known as “third-party Cookies” and are described below. Some Cookies are
            "session Cookies," which means that they are temporary Cookies that are only stored on
            your device while you are visiting our Site. Other Cookies are "persistent Cookies,"
            which means that they are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our
            Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose whether to accept Cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
            However, if you disable this function (or keep this function disabled, as set by default
            by certain browsers), your experience on the Site may be diminished and some features
            may not work as intended.

              Site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. Analytics Cookies allow

              person. We use information from Analytics Cookies to analyze the Site traffic, but we do
