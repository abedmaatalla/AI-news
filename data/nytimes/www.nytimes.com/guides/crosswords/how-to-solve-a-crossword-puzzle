<blockquote><em>A crossword puzzle is not a test of intelligence, and solving is not really about the size of your vocabulary. Becoming a good solver is about understanding what the clues are asking you to do.</em></blockquote>
<p>You can absolutely learn to do that. We’re here to let you in on some of the rules that most clues follow, and to teach you how to read those clues so that they become easier to solve. It would be impossible to cover every instance of clueing, but we can get you up and running. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve even included some tips and encouragement from the puzzle pros to help keep you motivated, like our very funny friend, Megan Amram, a writer for television shows like “The Simpsons” and “The Good Place.” Ms. Amram is a devoted solver and has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2016/06/23"><u>made a puzzle </u></a>that ran in The New York Times.</p>
<blockquote><em>“I understand how intimidating starting the crossword can be, but the bottom line is, believe in yourself. YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DO THE PUZZLE. Look at me. I do The New York Times crossword puzzle every day, and I once tried to shoot a basket on the wrong hoop when I was on my 6th grade basketball team. Crossword puzzles are not about intelligence, they are about keeping your mind nimble and knowing what the sneaky trickster Will Shortz is asking of you. Show Will Shortz who's boss by attempting the puzzle!” </em>— <a href="https://twitter.com/meganamram"><u>Megan Amram</u></a></blockquote>

<p>This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.</p>
<p>So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?</p>
<p><strong>The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week.</strong> Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the hardest, or involve the most wordplay. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest.

<p><strong>The Monday Clue: </strong><em>“Nabisco cookie,” “Cookie with creme filling” or “‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”</em></p>
<p><strong>The Saturday Clue: </strong><em>“Snack since 1912,” “It has 12 flowers on each side” or “Sandwich often given a twist”</em></p>
<p>The answer to all of these clues is the same: “OREO.” Those delicious sandwich cookies are so popular in crossword puzzles that they’ve been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword.</p>
<p>But we weren’t kidding you. There is a <em>big</em> difference between a Monday puzzle clue and a Saturday puzzle one. Late-week clues might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats.</p>
<p>If you’re just getting started, <strong>make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can</strong>.

<p>Let’s look at an example of why it pays to work those crossings. You might not see this in a Monday puzzle, but say the clue is “Black Halloween animal,” and you have confidently written in “CAT.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you look at the entry that crosses the first letter of CAT and the clue is “Honest ___ (presidential moniker).” The answer to that one is ABE, so CAT must be wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what do you do?</p>
<p>Stay flexible and remember that a BAT is <em>also</em> a “black Halloween animal.” Yes, it’s tricky, but it’s doable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversely, you can also work your way through an answer that you can’t get completely by solving the crossings. Once you have enough letters filled in, take your best guess based on the pattern of letters you’ve uncovered.</p>

<p>Let me say something that may be controversial, but it needs to be said: It’s O.K. to look something up when solving a crossword.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosswords are ultimately learning tools, whether you’re learning some trivia or an interesting new word or phrase. When you look something up, you’re learning so you’ll know it for next time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, some solvers may tell you that looking up the answer to a clue is “cheating,” but to us, that way lies frustration and a path to giving up. And that’s no fun. Crosswords are a game, and games are supposed to be fun.&nbsp;</p>

It would be LOVED, because that’s the past tense form.</p>
<p>Give your new knowledge a try with this mini. Some clues and answers will be present tense, some will be past tense. Just remember to make sure that the tenses of each clue and its answer match.

<p>There are a few different ways you might see plural answers clued:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The plural noun answer GRAPES might be clued “They might be sour.” “They” indicates the plural.</li>
  <li>The plural noun answer STATES might be clued as “North <em>and</em> South Dakota,” because the “and” indicates more than one state.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you are struggling with an answer that has a plural clue, you can make yourself feel like you’ve at least got a grip on it by dropping the letter “S” in at the end. Then, come back when you have enough letters filled in from the crossings to solve the rest of the entry.</p></div></div></section><section id="plural" class="5925769935060992 advancedcard card-related related" data-reactid="305"><div class="related-guide row list-item" data-reactid="306"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/special/plurals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-reactid="307"><!-- react-text: 308 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="related-guide-content" data-reactid="309"><h3 data-reactid="310">The Mini</h3><h4 data-reactid="311">Plurals</h4><div data-reactid="312"><p>See if you can keep your plurals matching.

<p>If there is a non-English word or phrase in the crossword, the clue will signal it by either including a word or phrase in the same language, or by connecting the answer to a place where that language is spoken or a person who might speak it. For the most part, foreign words or phrases included in puzzles they are very common words that most people will know, providing they paid attention in their high school language classes.</p>
<p>For example, the Spanish word ESTA, which means “this” or “it is,” might be clued early in the week as “It is, en español.” Don’t worry, the answer is in your brain somewhere. And remember: If you need to, take a break and come back to the puzzle. And work those crossings.</p>
<p>You might also see ESTA clued as “It is, in Ibiza” or “This, in Tijuana.”</p>
<p>A tantalizing glimpse at the late week wordplay you can look forward to when you push past the Mondays: If the entry was in a deviously tricky late-week puzzle, you might see the clue: “What this is in Spain.”&nbsp;</p>

The answer is likely to be a pun, a misdirection, or some other type of wordplay. Ask yourself if the words in the clues might have different meanings from the ones you think they do.</p>
<p>These are the forehead slappers of crossword clues. The puzzle maker and the editor are playing around with words and phrases in a clue like this, so free your mind up and think about other ways the words in the clues might be used. <em>Question everything.</em></p>
<p>Solvers will often see a “?” in clues that are part of a crossword theme involving wordplay, but any clue involving wordplay could conceivably have a “?” A clue might receive a “?” depending on on how “stretchy” it is — that is, how far a clue is from being factually true. It may also depend on which day of the week the clue appears: Early week puzzles might get a “?” to help you, whereas later week clues might not.</p>
<p>But the most important thing to remember is that this is when it really gets fun. So it’s worth it to practice.</p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Fitness center?”</strong> On the surface, this clue sounds like it’s asking for a GYM, since a gym is also known as a fitness center. But what if we told you that the answer is a four-letter word? Can you think of any other way the words in the clues can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>When you are trying to stay fit, it’s important to work the center of your body, or your CORE.&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Current events?”</strong> Here’s another clue that misdirects you from a popular phrase to something totally different. On the surface, you might think that the clue is asking you about the current events you read about in the newspaper, but think: What <em>other</em> kinds of currents do you know? The answer is five letters long.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>The answer is TIDES, because they are events that involve currents in the sea.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Sneaky? Maybe. But we promise you’ll learn to love this, and the more you practice solving, the easier it will be to spot these delicious opportunities to play with words and language.</p></div></div></section><section id="question-marks" class="4943939874324480 advancedcard card-related related" data-reactid="486"><div class="related-guide row list-item" data-reactid="487"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/special/question-mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-reactid="488"><!-- react-text: 489 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="related-guide-content" data-reactid="490"><h3 data-reactid="491">The Mini</h3><h4 data-reactid="492">Question Marks</h4><div data-reactid="493"><p>Any questions?

<p>Language is a living, evolving thing, and the entries in the crossword tend to reflect that. Therein lies a challenge: Older solvers have to keep up with our changing language and younger solvers have to learn words that might have fallen out of favor long before they were born.</p>
<p>People who have not yet learned to enjoy The New York Times Crossword tend to believe that it is a stodgy pursuit for older people, but the truth is, there are both modern and retro references in almost every puzzle. So while you might see the words MASHER (slang for a man who makes often unwelcome advances to women) and MOOLA (slang for money), you will also see BAE (slang for a boyfriend or girlfriend) and BROMANCE (slang for a close, platonic friendship between two men).</p></div></div></section><section id="slang" class="4866218683006976 advancedcard card-related related" data-reactid="500"><div class="related-guide row list-item" data-reactid="501"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/special/slang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-reactid="502"><!-- react-text: 503 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="related-guide-content" data-reactid="504"><h3 data-reactid="505">The Mini</h3><h4 data-reactid="506">Slang</h4><div data-reactid="507"><p>“Keep it 100” with this slang mini.</p></div><button type="button" data-reactid="508">Solve it!</button></div></a></div></section></section></li><li class="" data-reactid="509"><section class="5206561521664000 textgroup wrapper undefined multi-steps" data-reactid="510"><section class="5277766610059264 text" data-reactid="511"><div class="text-container" data-reactid="512"><div data-reactid="513"><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Clues in quotes and brackets will make it seem like your puzzle is talking to you. It’s only a problem if you answer.</p>
<p>A clue that is in quotes can be the title of a song, a movie or a book. But it can also mean something else: A clue in quotes that is something someone might say out loud has an answer that is a synonym for that verbalization. Here are a few examples of clues with possible answers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Stop!”: </strong>HALT, ENOUGH, HOLD IT, FREEZE</li>
  <li><strong>“That’s the way the cookie crumbles”:</strong> C’EST LA VIE</li>
  <li><strong>“I goofed!”:</strong> MY BAD</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>You might also see clues in brackets. A clue in brackets suggests an answer that might be nonverbal:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>[That’s painful]:</strong> GRIMACE</li>
  <li><strong>[I don’t care]: </strong>SHRUG</li>
  <li><strong>[!!!!]:</strong> I’M SHOCKED</li>

<p>Talk about tough cluing. This type of clue requires careful reading.</p>
<p>When the crossword constructor and the editors are feeling particularly diabolical, you might see an innocent-looking clue like this for a three letter entry:</p>
<p><strong>“Brave opponent”</strong></p>
<p>Hey, someone is calling their adversary “brave.” That’s nice. On the surface, this clue looks like a compliment, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not this time. The answer to that clue is RED. Depending on the puzzle, it might also be MET.</p>
<p>We know. That makes no sense at first glance, but don’t give up. There’s logic behind this, we promise.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the clue: The word “Brave” has a capital B because it is at the beginning of the clue, but that is <em>not the only reason it’s capitalized</em>. It has a capital B because it <em>also</em> happens to be the name of a professional baseball player, an Atlanta Brave. The puzzle maker and the editors put it at the beginning of the clue to capitalize on (sorry), or take advantage of, the capital letter.</p>
<p>And a three letter “Brave opponent,” or an opponent of an Atlanta Brave, could be a Cincinnati RED. It might also be a New York MET.</p>
<p>As we said, there may be a lot of forehead slapping as you get into the late week puzzles, but hang in there. We promise you’ll start to enjoy the lengths to which the puzzle makers and editors go to twist your brain.</p></div></div></section><section id="veiled-capitals" class="6421168642850816 advancedcard card-related related" data-reactid="528"><div class="related-guide row list-item" data-reactid="529"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/special/veiled-capitals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-reactid="530"><!-- react-text: 531 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="related-guide-content" data-reactid="532"><h3 data-reactid="533">The Mini</h3><h4 data-reactid="534">Veiled Capitals</h4><div data-reactid="535"><p>Time to practice again.

<p><strong>Tip: </strong>When you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it probably has a rebus element.</p>
<p>Solvers either love rebuses or they hate them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rebus element can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, <strong>the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside</strong> <strong>a single square</strong><em>. </em>Many solvers ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in a puzzle, and the answer is no, that’s part of the fun of solving. It’s also frustrating if you don’t figure out what’s going on. (That’s also why rebuses are generally reserved for Thursday and Sunday puzzles, says Joel Fagliano, the digital puzzles editor.)</p>
<p>Let’s say you see a clue that reads “Do-it-yourselfer's activity,” and the allotted space you are given for the answer is eight squares. Maybe you guessed right off the bat (or you used those crossings!) that the answer is HOME REPAIR. But HOME REPAIR would need 10 squares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, start to consider the theme of the puzzle. If you tighten your belt and squeeze multiple letters into a single square, you’ll end up with the word “air” in one square. This puzzle maker made the word AIR a rebus element in eight squares, where the rebus worked for both the Across and Down clues.&nbsp;</p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item list-item-overwrites list-item-media" data-reactid="544"><section class="5100641454129152 media" data-reactid="545"><!-- react-text: 546 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="media-asset-layout-top" data-reactid="547"><div class="media-asset" data-reactid="548"><div data-reactid="549"></div></div><!-- react-text: 550 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="media-copy" data-reactid="551"><p>And what was the purpose of squeezing AIR into one square? To make “compressed AIR,” of course. Now that’s a nice Thursday theme.</p>
<p>Part of the fun is determining where in the entry the rebus belongs. You’ll really need to work the crossings to figure that out. If you are solving in print, of course, filling in the rebus will simply be a matter of writing small.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are solving online or in one of our apps, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html?_r=0"><u>there is an easy way to enter multiple letters in a single square.</u></a></p></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item list-item-overwrites list-item-advancedcard" data-reactid="552"><section id="rebus" class="5116880490594304 advancedcard card-related related" data-reactid="553"><div class="related-guide row list-item" data-reactid="554"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/special/rebus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-reactid="555"><!-- react-text: 556 --><!-- /react-text --><div class="related-guide-content" data-reactid="557"><h3 data-reactid="558">The Mini</h3><h4 data-reactid="559">Rebus</h4><div data-reactid="560"><p>Read up on how to put more than one letter in a square above and then practice with this mini puzzle.</p></div><button type="button" data-reactid="561">Solve it!</button></div></a></div></section></div><div class="row list-item list-item-overwrites list-item-media" data-reactid="562"><section id="heteronyms" class="5111951982067712 media" data-reactid="563"><h3 data-reactid="564">Clues That Use Heteronyms</h3><div class="media-asset-layout-bottom" data-reactid="565"><div class="media-copy" data-reactid="566"><p><br></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> We’ve saved the most confounding type of clue for last. Some clues use heteronyms to misdirect you. (We swear this is fun.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heteronyms are two or more words that are spelled identically but have different pronunciations and meanings, like “minute” (<em>MIN-it</em>), which is a unit of time, and “minute” (<em>my-NOOT</em>), which might mean tiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how much that unique facet of language enthralls our puzzle makers and editors. And they use it to their advantage.This might not seem completely fair, but if you’ve been learning the tricks to understanding the clues in the rest of this guide, it’s well within the bounds of fairness. You just have to learn to think like a constructor.</p>
<p>How about a short quiz to help you figure this out? Here are some particularly sneaky heteronym examples and the number of letters in their answers. We’d like you to guess those answers. You might want to spend some time staring at them until the heteronym reveals itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, question <em>everything</em>. Don’t allow any word to go unexamined.</p>
<p><strong>Heteronym Clues</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Minute, to a tot” (4 letters)</li>
  <li>“Nice one” (3 letters)</li>
  <li>“Light shower” (5 letters)</li>
  <li>“Polish person” (5 letters)</li>
  <li>“Refuse work?” (4, 3 letters)</li>
  <li>“Kitchen drawer?” (5 letters)</li>
  <li>“Begin at the beginning?” (8 letters)</li>
  <li>“Knockout number?” (5 letters)</li>
  <li>“One of them does?” (4 letters)</li>
  <li>“Moving supply” (5 letters) &nbsp;<em>(This one is Will Shortz’s favorite. He says it fooled everyone!)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Are you getting the hang of this yet? These are not easy, but keep staring, because that “Aha!” moment is really worth it.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="media-asset" data-reactid="567"><div data-reactid="568"></div></div></div></section></div><div class="row list-item list-item-overwrites list-item-text" data-reactid="569"><section class="6419070417108992 text" data-reactid="570"><div class="text-container" data-reactid="571"><div data-reactid="572"><p>Still stuck? Here are the answers with the reasoning behind them:</p>
<p><strong>Answers</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>ITTY</strong>: In this case, as in the example above, the word “minute” (pronounced ‘MIN-it’) is not meant to be a unit of time. It is the “minute” (‘my-NOOT’) meant to mean “small,” and a tot might use the word ITTY.</li>
  <li><strong>UNE</strong>: “Nice one” is a familiar phrase, but instead of the word “nice” meaning “good,” this “Nice” is capitalized because it is really the city in France. And the article “one” in French is the word UNE.</li>
  <li><strong>PRISM</strong>: &nbsp;Yes, we know. Bear with us. Typically, a “Light shower” would be a mild rainstorm. In this case, the word “shower” is not pronounced using the “ow” sound. It’s pronounced using the “oh” sound, as in something that shows light. And that would be a PRISM.</li>
  <li><strong>WAXER</strong>: Not “Polish” as in someone from Poland.” “Polish” as in someone who buffs things.</li>
  <li><strong>JUNK ART</strong>: To “Refuse work” <em>could</em> mean to turn down a job. Or, it could mean working with refuse or garbage, which means that one is creating JUNK ART.</li>
  <li><strong>AROMA</strong>: Everyone knows what a “Kitchen drawer” is, right? It’s that thing you keep your utensils in. Except when it’s something that lures people — or draws them — into the kitchen. And that “drawer” would be an AROMA.</li>
  <li><strong>MENACHEM</strong>: Remember when we talked about capitalized words at the beginnings of clues? “Begin at the beginning” is a common idiom, but in this clue the word “Begin” doesn’t mean to start; it refers to the former prime minister of Israel, MENACHEM Begin. “ … at the beginning” is an indicator that the clue is looking for what goes <em>before</em> “Begin.”</li>
  <li><strong>ETHER</strong>: On the surface, a “Knockout number” might be a really dazzling song and dance number. But there are other ways of knocking someone out and there are other meanings to the word “number,” even if they are diabolical. In this case, we are knocking someone out and numbing them with the use of the gas ETHER.</li>
  <li><strong>DEER</strong>: “One of them does?” sounds like a statement about compliance. But when pronounced with a long “O,” the word “does” in this clue is actually the word for female DEER.</li>
  <li><strong>LITHE</strong>: How long did you stare at the word “supply” before you got it? Not to worry, it took us a long time, too. A “Moving supply” (pronounced suh-PLY) could be a box, but we need a five letter word. What if we freed our minds up and thought about the word “supply” in a different way? Could it be ‘SUP-lee’ as in a “supple” move? Sure it could. To move supply is to be LITHE.</li>

<p>The number of types of themes you might see in crosswords is nearly infinite, so we can’t describe them here. But most commonly they involve playing with words.</p>
<p>They can use puns, anagrams, hidden words, common elements, letters added to familiar phrases to make new phrases, and much more. Some puzzle themes have visual themes.

Below is how these answers were clued in this puzzle. The theme clues are pretty straightforward — fittingly for a Monday puzzle — although the clue for DUST JACKET is playing with us. Even so, it’s not that hard, especially if you work the crossings.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>BOULDER</strong> DAM: “Colorado River landmark dedicated by F.D.R.”</li>
  <li><strong>ROCK</strong> LOBSTER: “Novelty B-52's song with the lyric ‘Watch out for that piranha”</li>

  <li><strong>DUST</strong> JACKET: “One covering a big story?”</li>

<p>Most solvers don’t fill in a theme entry without first solving some of the crossings, so don’t worry if you don’t know them right off the bat.

<p>In this puzzle, the theme entries were clued to make you think. They describe the punny phrase, not the one it’s based on, so it’s up to you to figure that out. Here’s how this puzzled was clued:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BEST<strong> SHELLER</strong>: “Winner of a pea-preparing contest?” (Original phrase: BEST SELLER)</li>
  <li>PICK UP<strong> SHTICKS</strong>: “Lotharios' lines in a singles bar?” (Original phrase: PICK UP STICKS)</li>

  <li>MARRY IN <strong>SHAM</strong>: “Phony wedding?” (Original phrase: MARRYIN’ SAM)</li>

You hate your officemate.</p>\n<p>So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?</p>\n<p><strong>The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week.</strong> Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the hardest, or involve the most wordplay.
