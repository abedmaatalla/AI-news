The girls' heads had been shaved, they had been taken to a checkpoint outside the village and they had been repeatedly raped.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="677">At the time, Mullah Omar was an obscure figure, a former guerrilla commander against occupying Soviet forces who had returned home in disgust at the terror mujahedeen groups were inflicting on Afghanistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="792">He was living as a student, or talib, in a mud-walled religious school that centered on rote learning of the Koran.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Gathering 30 former guerrilla fighters, who mustered between them 16 Kalashnikov rifles, he led an attack on the checkpoint, freed the girls and tied the checkpoint commander by a noose to the barrel of an old Soviet tank. As those around him shouted ''God is Great!'' Mullah Omar ordered the tank barrel raised and left the dead man hanging as a grisly warning.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="1598" id="story-continues-3">The Singesar episode is now part of Afghan folklore. Barely 30 months after taking up his rifle, Mullah Omar is the supreme ruler of most of Afghanistan. The mullah, a heavyset 38-year old who lost his right eye in the war against the Russians, is known to his followers as Prince of All Believers. He leads an Islamic religious movement, the Taliban, that has conquered 20 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="511" data-total-count="2109">Mullah Omar's call to arms in Singesar is only part of the story of the rise of the Taliban that emerged from weeks of traveling across Afghanistan and from scores of interviews with Afghans, diplomats and others who followed the movement from its earliest days in 1994. It is a story that is still unfolding, with the Taliban struggling to consolidate their hold on Kabul, the capital. The city fell three months ago to a Taliban force of a few thousand fighters, who entered the city with barely a shot fired.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="2389">But the Taliban, despite their protestations of independence, did not score their successes alone. Pakistani leaders saw domestic political gains in supporting the movement, which draws most of support from the ethnic Pashtun who predominate along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="2664">Perhaps more important, Pakistan's leaders, in funneling supplies of ammunition, fuel and food to the Taliban, hoped to advance an old Pakistani dream of linking their country, through Afghanistan, to an economic and political alliance with the Muslim states of Central Asia.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="2983">At crucial moments during the two years of the Taliban's rise to power, the United States stood aside. It did little to discourage support for the Afghan mullahs both from Pakistan and from another American ally, Saudi Arabia, which found its own reasons for supporting the Taliban in their conservative brand of Islam.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="3298">American officials emphatically deny the assertion, widely believed among the Taliban's opponents in Afghanistan, that the United States offered the movement covert support. American diplomats' frequent visits to Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban's governing body, the officials insist, were mainly exploratory.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="591" data-total-count="3889">In fact, American policy on the Taliban has seesawed back and forth. The Taliban have found favor with some American officials, who see in their implacable hostility toward Iran an important counterweight in the region. But other officials remain uncomfortable about the Taliban's policies on women, which they say have created the most backward-looking and intolerant society anywhere in Islam. And they say that the Taliban, despite promises to the contrary, have done nothing to root out the narcotics traffickers and terrorists who have found a haven in Afghanistan under the mujahedeen.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="896" data-total-count="4785" id="story-continues-4">In its most recent policy statement on Afghanistan, the State Department called on other nations to ''engage'' with the Taliban in hopes of moderating their policies. But the statement came as the Taliban were tightening still further their Islamic social code, particularly the taboos that have banned women from working, closed girls' schools, and required all women beyond puberty to cloak themselves head to toe in garments called burqas that are the traditional garb of Afghan village women. The result, so far, is that not a single one of the member countries of the United Nations has recognized the Taliban government and none have come forward with offers of the reconstruction aid the Taliban say will be needed to rebuild this shattered country. In the words of Mullah Mohammed Hassan, one of Mullah Omar's partners in the Taliban's ruling council, ''We are the pariahs of the world.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="11" data-total-count="4796">On the Rise</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="31" data-total-count="4827">Catching the Tide Of Discontent</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="515" data-total-count="5342">How the Taliban succeeded in pacifying much of a country that had spent years spiraling into chaos is not, as their progress from Singesar to Kabul attests, primarily a question of military prowess. Much more, it was a matter of a group of Islamic nationalists catching a high tide of discontent that built up when the mujahedeen turned from fighting Russians to plundering, and just as often killing, their own people. By 1994, after five years of mujahedeen terror, the Taliban was a movement whose time had come.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="480" data-total-count="5822">One man who has seen more of the Taliban than any other outsider, Rahimullah Yusufzai, a reporter for The News in Pakistan, put it simply: ''The story of the Taliban is not one of outsiders imposing a solution, but of the Afghans themselves seeking deliverance from mujahedeen groups that had become cruel and inhuman. The Afghan people had been waiting a long time for relief from their miseries, and they would have accepted anybody who would have freed them from the tyranny.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="5948">In any case, Mullah Omar contends that the decision to act at Singesar was not, at the time, envisaged as a step toward power.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="6286">Although he is universally known in Afghanistan as mullah, or giver of knowledge, he is a shy man who still calls himself a talib, or seeker after knowledge. He has met only once with a foreign reporter, Mr. Yusufzai. Mullah Omar said at their meeting in Kandahar that the men at Singesar intended originally only to help local villagers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="6451">''We were fighting against Muslims who had gone wrong,'' he said. ''How could we remain quiet when we could see crimes being committed against women, and the poor?''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="6811">But appeals were soon coming in from villages all around Kandahar. At about the time the two girls were being abducted in Singesar, which is in the Maiwand district 35 miles to the west, two other mujahedeen commanders had confronted each other with tanks in a bazaar in Kandahar, arguing over possession of a young boy both men wanted as a homosexual partner.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="7006">In the ensuing battle, dozens of civilians shopping and trading in the bazaar were killed. After the Taliban took control of Kandahar, those commanders, too, ended up hanging from Taliban nooses.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="469" data-total-count="7475" id="story-continues-5">With each new action against the mujahedeen, the Taliban's manpower, and arsenal, grew. Mujahedeen fighters, and sometimes whole units, switched sides, so that the Taliban quickly came to resemble a coalition of many of the country's fighting groups. The new recruits included many men who had served in crucial military positions as pilots, tank commanders and front-line infantry officers in the Afghan Communist forces that fought under Soviet control in the 1980's.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="470" data-total-count="7945">After a skirmish in September 1994 at Spinbaldak, on the border with Pakistan netted the new movement 800 truckloads of arms and ammunition that had been stored in caves since the Soviet occupation, there was no force to match the Taliban. Moving rapidly east and west of Kandahar in the winter of 1994 and the spring of 1995, they rolled up territory. Sometimes, using money said to have come from Saudi Arabia, Taliban commanders paid mujahedeen commanders to give up.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="8297">But mostly, it was enough for Taliban units to appear on the horizon with the fluttering white flags symbolizing their Islamic puritanism. ''In most places, the people welcomed the Taliban as a deliverance, so there was no need to fight,'' recalled Mr. Yusufzai, the Pakistani reporter, who has spent more time with the Taliban than any other outsider.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="8667">Another event in September 1994 gave the Taliban their most important external backer. Naseerullah Babar, Pakistan's Interior Minister, had a vision for extricating his wedge-shaped country from the precarious position in which it was placed when it was created in 1947 by the partition of India from territories running along British India's frontiers with Afghanistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="504" data-total-count="9171">Mr. Babar saw a Pakistan linked to the newly independent Muslim republics of what had been Soviet Central Asia, along roads and railways running across Afghanistan. He believed that stability in Afghanistan would mean a potential economic bonanza for Pakistan and a strategic breakthrough for the West. ''It was in the West's overall interest,'' he said in an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. ''Unless the Central Asian states have an opening to the sea, they will never be free from Russia.''</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="9511">With the rise of Taliban power around Kandahar, Mr. Babar spied a chance to prove the vision's practicability. Using Pakistan Government funds, he arranged a ''peace convoy'' of heavily loaded trucks to run rice, clothing and other gifts north from Quetta in Pakistan, through Kandahar, and onward to Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="9847">But outside the American-built airport at Kandahar, a mujahedeen commander guarding one of the thousands of checkpoints that had made an obstacle course of any Afghan journey seized the convoy, demanding ransom. Once again, the Taliban intervened, freeing the convoy and hanging, again from a tank barrel, the commander who hijacked it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="418" data-total-count="10265">Mr. Babar's subsequent enthusiasm for the Taliban gave rise to a widespread belief among the the group's opponents that they were a Pakistani creation, or at least that their growing military power was sustained by cash, arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Because of Pakistan's close ties with the United States, it was a short step for these Taliban opponents to conclude that Washington was also backing the Taliban.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="10496">After Kabul fell in September, Americans venturing into non-Taliban areas north of Kabul faced a common taunt from soldiers of the ousted Government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. ''The Taliban are American puppets!'' they said.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="172" data-total-count="10668" id="story-continues-6">But while that was not accurate, there were ties between American officials and the growing movement that were considerably broader than those to any other Western country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="11056">From early on, American diplomats in Islamabad had made regular visits to Kandahar to see Taliban leaders. In briefings for reporters, the diplomats cited what they saw as positive aspects of the Taliban, which they listed as a capacity to end the war in Afghanistan and its promises to put an end to the use of Afghanistan as a base for narcotics trafficking and international terrorism.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="11275">Unmentioned, but probably most important to Washington, was that the Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, have a deep hostility for Iran, America's nemesis, where the ruling majority belong to the rival Shiite sect of Islam.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="11648">Along the way, Washington developed yet another interest in the Taliban as potential backers for a 1,200-mile gas pipeline that an American energy company, Union Oil Company of California, has proposed building from Quetta, in Pakistan, to Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic that sits atop some of the world's largest gas reserves, but has limited means to export them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="11973">The project, which Unocal executives have estimated could cost $5 billion, would be built in conjunction with the Delta Oil Company, a Saudi Arabian concern that also has close links to the Taliban. Among the advisers Unocal has employed to deal with the Taliban is Robert B. Oakley, a former American Ambassador to Pakistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="423" data-total-count="12396">American officials, however, denied providing any direct assistance, covert or otherwise, to the Taliban. Similar assurances were given to Russia and India, as well as indirectly to Iran, countries that were involved in heavy arms shipments of their own to the Taliban's main opponents, the armies of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and President Rabbani that control the 12 northern provinces that continue to resist the Taliban.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="12623">''We do not have any relationship with the Taliban, and we never have had,'' David Cohen, the Central Intelligence Agency official who directs the agency's clandestine operations, told Indian officials in New Delhi in November.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="12983">Mr. Babar offered similar denials, asserting that ''there has been no financial or material aid to the Taliban from Pakistan.'' But Western intelligence officials in Pakistan said the denials were a smokescreen for a policy of covert support that Mr. Babar, a retired Pakistani general, had extended to the Taliban after the convoy episode at Kandahar airport.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="13288" id="story-continues-7">That support, the intelligence officials said, apart from ammunition and fuel, included the deployment at crucial junctures of Pakistani military advisers. The advisers were easy to hide, since they were almost all ethnic Pashtuns, from the same tribe that make up an overwhelming majority of the Taliban.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="13303">Gaining Support</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="13335">To U.S. Diplomats A Rosy Picture</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="13612">American officials like Robin Raphel, the top State Department official dealing directly with matters involving Afghanistan, have placed heavy emphasis on the hope that contacts with the new rulers in Kabul will encourage them to soften their policies, especially toward women.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="476" data-total-count="14088">They also say that the United States sees the Taliban, with its Islamic conservatism, as the best, and perhaps the only, chance that Afghanistan will halt the poppy growing and opium production that have made Afghanistan, with an estimated 2,500 tons of raw opium a year, the world's biggest single-country source of the narcotic. A similar argument is made on the issue of the network of international terrorists, many of them Arabs, who have set up bases inside Afghanistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="378" data-total-count="14466">But as the Taliban consolidate their power in Kabul, the signs of cooperation are not strong. In the week before Christmas, as bitterly cold winds from the 20,000-foot Hindu Kush mountains swept down on Kabul, senior Taliban officials seemed to be in a more pugnacious mood than in October, when a counteroffensive by the Rabbani and Dostum forces came within 10 miles of Kabul.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="14645">The attacking forces have since been driven back beyond artillery range, allowing the Taliban to concentrate on tightening their grip on Kabul's restive population of 1.5-million.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="465" data-total-count="15110">The sense that those Taliban leaders now give is that they see little reason to accommodate the West. Reports from United Nations officials monitoring drug flows suggest the Taliban have done nothing to impede the trafficking and that in the key provinces of Helmand and Nangarhar -- accounting for more than 90 per cent of the opium production -- they are in league with the drug producers, taxing them, and storing some of the opium in Taliban-guarded warehouses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="12" data-total-count="15122">Turning Away</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="36" data-total-count="15158">Elusive Positions On West's Concerns</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="15414">Confronted with these reports, Taliban leaders have a stock response. ''We intend to stop the drug trafficking, because it is against Islamic laws,'' they have said. ''But until we can rebuild our economy, there are no other jobs, so now is not the time.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="481" data-total-count="15895">The Taliban position on those who support international terrorists is still more elusive. According to Western intelligence estimates, as many as 400 trained terrorists are living in areas under Taliban control, some of them with links to the groups that mounted the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993 and other major attacks, including the attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Ethiopia in 1995 and attacks in France by Algerian militants.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="16242" id="story-continues-8">One of the most-wanted men of all, Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian businessman who has been called one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremists in the world by the State Department, has been spotted within the past month at a heavily guarded home in the Afghan city of Jalalabad, held by the Taliban since early September.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="616" data-total-count="16858">But it is on their treatment of women that Western governments' attitudes seem most likely to hinge, and on that matter the Taliban show no sign of relenting. After a Taliban radio bulletin earlier this month celebrated the fact that 250 Kabul women had been beaten by Taliban in a single day for not observing the dress code, an Australian working as a coordinator for private Western aid agencies in Kabul, Ross Everson, visited one of the city's top Taliban officials, Mullah Mohammed Mutaqi, to appeal for a turn toward what Mr. Everson called ''the doctrine of moderation that the Islamic faith is famous for.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="17123">Mullah Mutaqi stood up and waved his fist in Mr. Everson's face. ''You are insulting us,'' he said, Then, snuggling back into the blanket that Taliban officials wear around their shoulders for warmth in the unheated offices of Kabul, he made his clinching argument.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="17405">''I must ask you, are you the Muslim here, or am I?'' he said. ''If you Westerners want to help us, you are welcome. Otherwise you are free to leave Afghanistan. You may think we cannot survive without you, but I can tell you, God will provide the Taliban with everything we need.''</p><aside class="story-content subscriptions-module hidden" id="subscriptions-module"></aside><footer class="story-footer story-content">
