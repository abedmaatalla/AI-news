Most other American electronics companies had already gone abroad, and Apple, which at the time was struggling, felt it had to grasp every advantage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="8917">In part, Asia was attractive because the semiskilled workers there were cheaper. But that wasn’t driving Apple. For technology companies, the cost of labor is minimal compared with the expense of buying parts and managing supply chains that bring together components and services from hundreds of companies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="9223">For Mr. Cook, the focus on Asia “came down to two things,” said one former high-ranking Apple executive. Factories in Asia “can scale up and down faster” and “Asian supply chains have surpassed what’s in the U.S.” The result is that “we can’t compete at this point,” the executive said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="9319">The impact of such advantages became obvious as soon as Mr. Jobs demanded glass screens in 2007.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="499" data-total-count="9818">For years, cellphone makers had avoided using glass because it required precision in cutting and grinding that was extremely difficult to achieve. Apple had already selected an American company, <a href="http://www.corninggorillaglass.com/">Corning Inc.</a>, to manufacture large panes of strengthened glass. But figuring out how to cut those panes into millions of iPhone screens required finding an empty cutting plant, hundreds of pieces of glass to use in experiments and an army of midlevel engineers. It would cost a fortune simply to prepare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="55" data-total-count="9873">Then a bid for the work arrived from a Chinese factory.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="565" data-total-count="10438">When an Apple team visited, the Chinese plant’s owners were already constructing a new wing. “This is in case you give us the contract,” the manager said, according to a former Apple executive. The Chinese government had agreed to underwrite costs for numerous industries, and those subsidies had trickled down to the glass-cutting factory. It had a warehouse filled with glass samples available to Apple, free of charge. The owners made engineers available at almost no cost. They had built on-site dormitories so employees would be available 24 hours a day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="10468">The Chinese plant got the job.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="10770">“The entire supply chain is in China now,” said another former high-ranking Apple executive. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets?

It will take three hours.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="17" data-total-count="10787"><strong> In <org idsrc="nyt-org" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about Foxconn Technology.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/foxconn_technology/index.html"><alt-code value="Foxconn Technology" idsrc="nyt-org"></alt-code>Foxconn</org> City </strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="11062">An eight-hour drive from that glass factory is a complex, known informally as Foxconn City, where the iPhone is assembled.

The first truckloads of cut glass arrived at Foxconn City in the dead of night, according to the former Apple executive. That’s when managers woke thousands of workers, who crawled into their uniforms — white and black shirts for men, red for women — and quickly lined up to assemble, by hand, the phones. Within three months, Apple had sold one million iPhones. Since then, Foxconn has assembled over 200 million more.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="13029">Foxconn, in statements, declined to speak about specific clients.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="13371">“Any worker recruited by our firm is covered by a clear contract outlining terms and conditions and by Chinese government law that protects their rights,” the company wrote.

They grow, but they don’t really need to hire much.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="437" data-total-count="16283">It is hard to estimate how much more it would cost to build iPhones in the United States. However, various academics and manufacturing analysts estimate that because labor is such a small part of technology manufacturing, paying American wages would add up to $65 to each iPhone’s expense. Since Apple’s profits are often hundreds of dollars per phone, building domestically, in theory, would still give the company a healthy reward.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="458" data-total-count="16741">But such calculations are, in many respects, meaningless because building the iPhone in the United States would demand much more than hiring Americans — it would require transforming the national and global economies. Apple executives believe there simply aren’t enough American workers with the skills the company needs or factories with sufficient speed and flexibility. Other companies that work with Apple, like Corning, also say they must go abroad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="17171">Manufacturing glass for the iPhone revived a Corning factory in <location style="Y" location-code="travel:::Go to the Kentucky Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/kentucky/overview.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Kentucky" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Kentucky</location>, and today, much of the glass in iPhones is still made there. After the iPhone became a success, Corning received a flood of orders from other companies hoping to imitate Apple’s designs. Its strengthened glass sales have grown to more than $700 million a year, and it has hired or continued employing about 1,000 Americans to support the emerging market.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="17304">But as that market has expanded, the bulk of Corning’s strengthened glass manufacturing has occurred at plants in Japan and Taiwan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="17678">“Our customers are in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China,” said James B. Flaws, Corning’s vice chairman and chief financial officer. “We could make the glass here, and then ship it by boat, but that takes 35 days. Or, we could ship it by air, but that’s 10 times as expensive. So we build our glass factories next door to assembly factories, and those are overseas.”</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

They bought a home with a pool.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="18867">“It felt like, finally, school was paying off,” he said. “I knew the world needed people who can build things.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="612" data-total-count="19479">At the same time, however, the electronics industry was changing, and Apple — with products that were declining in popularity — was struggling to remake itself. One focus was improving manufacturing. A few years after Mr. Saragoza started his job, his bosses explained how the California plant stacked up against overseas factories: the cost, excluding the materials, of building a $1,500 computer in Elk Grove was $22 a machine. In <location style="Y" location-code="world:::More news and information about Singapore.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/singapore/index.html|||travel:::Go to the Singapore Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/singapore/overview.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Singapore" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Singapore</location>, it was $6. In Taiwan, $4.85. Wages weren’t the major reason for the disparities. Rather it was costs like inventory and how long it took workers to finish a task.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="19635">“We were told we would have to do 12-hour days, and come in on Saturdays,” Mr. Saragoza said. “I had a family. I wanted to see my kids play soccer.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="417" data-total-count="20052">Modernization has always caused some kinds of jobs to change or disappear. As the American economy transitioned from agriculture to manufacturing and then to other industries, farmers became steelworkers, and then salesmen and middle managers. These shifts have carried many economic benefits, and in general, with each progression, even unskilled workers received better wages and greater chances at upward mobility.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="20439">But in the last two decades, something more fundamental has changed, economists say. Midwage jobs started disappearing. Particularly among Americans without college degrees, today’s new jobs are disproportionately in service occupations — at restaurants or call centers, or as hospital attendants or temporary workers — that offer fewer opportunities for reaching the middle class.</p><div id="story-ad-8" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="475" data-total-count="20914" id="story-continues-10">Even Mr. Saragoza, with his college degree, was vulnerable to these trends. First, some of Elk Grove’s routine tasks were sent overseas. Mr. Saragoza didn’t mind. Then the robotics that made Apple a futuristic playground allowed executives to replace workers with machines. Some diagnostic engineering went to Singapore. Middle managers who oversaw the plant’s inventory were laid off because, suddenly, a few people with Internet connections were all that were needed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="501" data-total-count="21415">Mr. Saragoza was too expensive for an unskilled position. He was also insufficiently credentialed for upper management. He was called into a small office in 2002 after a night shift, laid off and then escorted from the plant. He taught high school for a while, and then tried a return to technology. But Apple, which had helped anoint the region as “Silicon Valley North,” had by then converted much of the Elk Grove plant into an AppleCare call center, where new employees often earn $12 an hour.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="21640">There were employment prospects in Silicon Valley, but none of them panned out. “What they really want are 30-year-olds without children,” said Mr. Saragoza, who today is 48, and whose family now includes five of his own.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="473" data-total-count="22113">After a few months of looking for work, he started feeling desperate. Even teaching jobs had dried up. So he took a position with an electronics temp agency that had been hired by Apple to check returned iPhones and iPads before they were sent back to customers. Every day, Mr. Saragoza would drive to the building where he had once worked as an engineer, and for $10 an hour with no benefits, wipe thousands of glass screens and test audio ports by plugging in headphones.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="22132"><strong> Paydays for Apple </strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="22470">As Apple’s overseas operations and sales have expanded, its top employees have thrived.

The bounty has also enriched Apple workers. Last fiscal year, in addition to their salaries, Apple’s employees and directors received stock worth $2 billion and exercised or vested stock and options worth an added $1.4 billion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="388" data-total-count="23282">The biggest rewards, however, have often gone to Apple’s top employees. Mr. Cook, Apple’s chief, last year received <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/1640544083x0xS1193125-12-6704/320193/filing.pdf">stock grants</a> — which vest over a 10-year period — that, at today’s share price, would be worth $427 million, and his salary was raised to $1.4 million. In 2010, Mr. Cook’s compensation package was valued at $59 million, according to Apple’s security filings.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="23615">A person close to Apple argued that the compensation received by Apple’s employees was fair, in part because the company had brought so much value to the nation and world. As the company has grown, it has expanded its domestic work force, including manufacturing jobs. Last year, Apple’s American work force grew by 8,000 people.</p><div id="story-ad-9" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">
