<div class="summary">
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>How can I tell how difficult a puzzle will</strong><strong> be?  How can I get help solving?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>The daily puzzles increase in difficulty from Monday to Saturday. The Sunday puzzle, while larger than the others, is approximately as difficult as the Wednesday or the Thursday puzzle.  In the mobile apps, during your first seven days after downloading the app, we provide indicators next to each daily puzzle that reflect the difficulty of each puzzle.</p>
<p>We're here to help you solve and get better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get started with our "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle">How to Solve The New York Times Crossword</a>" guide which includes various ways to tackle a puzzle and includes 13 free Mini puzzles to help you learn each concept</li>
<li>If you are stuck on today's puzzle, you can read the daily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/wordplay">Wordplay column</a> that dissects tricky clues and themes for that day's puzzle.  To get to today's puzzle's column there are links near the puzzle
<ul>
<li>online - there's a link just below the puzzle</li>
<li>apps - above the puzzle grid, click in the (i) button and you will find a link on this page that goes directly to the column for every puzzle since July 1, 2017</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interact with our <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTimesWordplay">Wordplay Twitter</a> account for encouragement</li>
<li>On most Thursdays you can join us at 1pm ET for a live solve of the Thursday puzzles, which often have a tricky component that can confound solvers, at www.facebook.com/NYTimes</li>
<li>Still have questions? Connect with other solvers via the Comments section on the Wordplay column for that day's puzzle who'll be glad to lend a hand.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="element1 question_text">
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> One particular tricky puzzle scheme is for the constructor to put more than one letter in a square - this is called a Rebus. <span>As a solver you have to deduce when a square might have multiple letters in it. </span>You can usually tell when you KNOW you have the right answer but it doesn't fit.  <span>Read more about how to enter a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html"><span>Rebus</span></a><span> in a puzzle online or in our app.</span> </p>
<p><strong>4. When do puzzles become available?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">Each daily crossword puzzle is available the evening before it appears in the newspaper. On weekdays, the puzzle is available at 10 p.m. E.T. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday, for Sunday and Monday’s puzzles), the puzzle is available at 6 p.m. E.T.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>To receive alerts on your device when the newest daily puzzle is available, enable push notifications.  If you rejected push notifications and want to re-enable them, you may need to go into your system settings under notifications and re-enable notifications for Crosswords.</p>
<p>The weekly variety puzzles are available on NYTimes.com the Thursday before appearing in the Sunday magazine. The monthly bonus puzzles are available online on the first day of the month. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="element1 question_text"><strong>5. Can I link my account between the app and the website? How do I do this?</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>Yes. You can link your account between the app and the website, and we encourage you to do so. You can work on the same puzzle throughout your day from different devices and the web and have a complete record of puzzles you’ve solved wherever you go.</p>
<p>If you subscribed online, go to Account Settings in the app and tap <strong>Log In/Create</strong>. Type in the email address and password associated with your subscription and tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</p>
<p>Go to the Account Settings page in the app (under the<img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/account_settings.png" alt=""> icon in the top right corner of the front page) and tap Log In. You can create a free NYTimes.com account if you don't already have one. If you subscribed via the web, type in the email address and password associated with your subscription and tap <strong>Log In</strong>. You should now have access to the puzzles in the app and on the web, and your puzzle progress should sync between the two.</p>
<p>If you subscribed through iTunes, Google Play or Amazon, you'll need to link your subscription to NYTimes.com to enable web access.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in/create an New York Times account as specified above,</li>
<li>tap <strong>Restore Purchases</strong> and, if prompted to do so, enter your Apple ID or Google ID and password. Please note, you must log in using the Apple ID or Google ID which purchased the app.</li>
<li>Finally, tap the Connect Account button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your NYTimes.com account should now have full crossword entitlements and can be used to access your subscription on the web or in the app on another device without having to Restore Purchases (pack purchases are app-only and cannot be linked to your NYTimes.com account at this time. If you have purchased packs, you will still have to Restore Purchases to access them on another device; currently packs are only accessible on the same platform where you purchased them - see below for more about puzzle packs). </p>
<p><strong>6. </strong><strong>If I bought in my subscription in an app store, what are the benefits of creating an account and connecting it?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The single biggest benefit is if you lose your device or upgrade to a new phone, our servers will have saved all your puzzle progress.  Until you connect your account as noted below, all your progress is only stored locally on your device. </li>
<li>The second benefit is that if you want to play across devices, we tie in your subscription entitlements regardless of what platform you are on.  This allows you to play across your desktop at home or on your phone on the go.  It also allows us to manage if you decide to change your device from one platform or another.</li>
<li>Future benefits will include allowing your to buy puzzle packs across different platforms, regardless of what platform you purchased those puzzles from.  </li>
</ul>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>7. What do I do if I am having trouble accessing my subscription or Puzzle Packs in the mobile apps?</strong></p>
<div class="summary">
<ul>
<li>If you purchased your subscription through The New York Times website, be sure to log in with your same NYTimes ID and password.</li>
<li>If you purchased through a mobile platform, go to the Account Settings screen and tap <strong>Restore Purchases</strong>. If that doesn't work, log out and log back into your account. If that still doesn't work, double check that you are logged in with the iTunes or Google Play account through which you purchased subscription and try the steps above. </li>
<li>If you are still having issues, contact our customer support team - the best way to do this is to send an email to via the apps from the Account Settings screen as this sends along diagnostic information we can use to help you troubleshoot. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2"><strong>8. What devices will the app work on?</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2">The New York Times Crossword apps work on the following devices:</div>
<ul>
<li class="element2">iOS 10.0 or later</li>
<li class="element2">Android 5.0 or later</li>
<li class="element2">Kindle 8 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>If the latest operating system is not available for your device, you can continue to use the older version of the app. However, we will not be able to offer you technical support.  </p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2"><strong>9. The app is crashing or there is technical issue in the web site, who do I contact for technical help?</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2">The best way to get technical assistance is to contact us via the app or on the crossword web page because it sends along diagnostic information that allows us to troubleshoot the issue faster. You can find the feedback link via the following:</div>
<ul>
<li class="element2"><span>On the web, the SEND FEEDBACK button is located at the bottom of every page, under the SUPPORT column</span></li>
<li class="element2"><span>Within the iOS app, the FEEDBACK button is located on the bottom of the Account settings page</span></li>
<li class="element2"><span>Within the Android app,the FEEDBACK button is located within the dropdown menu bar located at the top left of the app screen</span>  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>10. How can I view and play puzzles from the archive?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">Access to our puzzle archive requires a subscription.  These are accessible via a <strong>Archive</strong> tab from the main screen across all platforms. You can then tap on the date at the top of the calendar screen to navigate through puzzles by month and year.  </div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>11. Can I solve puzzles in the app while I am offline?  How do I download them for offline use?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">Yes. As long as you have downloaded a puzzle, you can solve it while offline.  When you are in the calendar view of the archive, you can see an arrow in the upper right corner of the icon for that date, which means the puzzle is NOT downloaded to your device.  Clicking on the puzzle icon will download that puzzle to your device.  Going on a long flight or vacation? Download a bunch of puzzles to keep you occupied for hours.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will need to restore your network connection to sync your progress with your other devices and the web.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Puzzles don't take much space on your device, but we also remove puzzles from your device if you've solved them over 30 days ago.  You can always re-download them and your progress is maintained on our servers if you've connected your account.  You can also delete a puzzle on your iOS device by long-pressing the puzzle icon for a date. </p>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>12. What are Puzzle Packs?</strong></p>
<div class="summary">
<p>Puzzle Packs are curated collections of puzzles available in our apps.  Each Puzzle Pack is centered around a theme. Purchased packs appear in <strong>My Packs</strong>.  Puzzle packs are NOT included in the price of subscription - they are designed as an option for users who do not want to commit to a full subscription yet.</p>
<p>Many puzzle packs (Minis, Midis, All New Mondays) are brand new puzzles that have not appeared in print and are not availalbe in the archive - they are available exclusively to users who buy the pack. </p>
<p>There are also several packs (Monday, Mondays, Terrific Tuesdays, Wonderful Wednesdays, etc.) that are curated collections from our archive.  These can be denoted in the description which should include the phrase "from the archive."  Our subscribers already have access to these puzzles via the Archive. As a subscriber, you may also find that if you decide to purchase this pack, you may have completed some of the puzzles in this pack if you are an avid user of the Archive.  </p>
<p>Puzzle packs currently are only available for sale in our apps.  At the current time if you buy a pack on a specific platform (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon), you can only access that pack on the platform you purchased it on.  We are working on a way for you to access your packs across all platforms, regardless of where you purchased them, if you have connected your subscription to a New York Times account.  </p>

<p><strong>14. How do I print a puzzle or download an Across Lite puzzle?</strong></p>
<div class="summary">
<p>You can print puzzles by accessing the crossword from your browser on your desktop or phone (there is no printing function on the iOS or Android apps). You can also download PUZ files which can be opened and played in Across Lite (find out more about Across Lite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/content/help/games/acrosslite/acrosslite.html">here</a>). There are several areas where you can print: </p>
<p>a.) Printing Today’s Puzzle from the NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/index.html">Crossword Homepage</a></p>
<ul>
<li>click on the print icon in the upper right corner to print Today’s puzzle section.</li>
<li>click on the down arrow to download the PUZ file.</li>
<li>If you are a home delivery subscriber, you can print the newspaper version of the last eight days of puzzles through this interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_01.png" alt="" width="368" height="294"></p>
<p>b.) Printing Today’s Puzzle from the Puzzle Page from the desktop browser</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the print icon in the upper right corner to print Today’s puzzle section</li>
<li>click on the down arrow to download the PUZ file</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_02.png" alt="" width="639" height="246"></p>
<p> c.) Printing Today’s Puzzle from the Puzzle Page from a mobile browser</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the print icon in the middle left of the screen to print Today’s puzzle section</li>
<li>click on the down arrow to download the PUZ file</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_03.png" alt="" width="304" height="399"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.) Printing/downloading other puzzles</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you see an icon for a specific puzzle (as in the last 7 days list on the main page or in the archive calendar view), if you hover over the icon you will see a print and download button appear below the icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_04.png" alt="" width="271" height="198"></p>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_05.png" alt="" width="290" height="165"> </p>
<p>Note: if you are viewing the archive in calendar view on the iPad, the hover buttons do not appear and you should use the archive List View. In the archive List View you can click the word “Puzzle” to open a PDF for printing or you can click the word “Across Lite” to download the PUZ file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_print_06.png" alt="" width="592" height="326"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you click to print, you will be given the option to print the puzzle, the answers, or in some cases where available, the newspaper version of the puzzle. You can also use the ink saver to make the black squares less dark.</p>

<p><strong>15. How can I customize cursor movement in The Crossword?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">By default, the cursor will skip over squares that are already filled in and stop at the end of each clue. To customize cursor movement, tap the gear icon in the upper right corner of any puzzle.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are typing into a square that is already filled, the cursor will always move to the next square. This way, you can easily overwrite a word. </p>
<p><strong>16. How do I get the solution to a puzzle? How do I know if I’ve solved the puzzle correctly?</strong></p>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">You will get a message (and a jingle) congratulating you if you solve the puzzle correctly. If the board is completely filled in but you have not received a message, there is at least one incorrect square.</div>
<p>If you are stuck, there are several tools at the top of the puzzle that you can use to check or reveal a square, an answer or the entire puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check will let you know whether the letter is answered correctly.  We also have a feature called Autocheck that will let you know if you've input the right letter as you are solving.  </li>
<li class="element2">Reveal will actually show you the answer for the square, word or the entire puzzle (Reveal All).</li>
</ul>
<div class="element2">For variety puzzles only available in printed form, the solution is posted on the archive page about a week after the puzzle is released.</div>
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2">For Spelling Bee puzzles, the full word list of the solution is presented the following day.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>(Side note: The jingle at the end of solving the puzzle is called the "San Jose Strut" but it is no longer available for purchase or distribution; it can be turned off in the settings for the puzzle)</p>
<p><strong>17. What is the difference between the pen and pencil modes? How do I switch between them?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>You can use pencil mode to indicate that you are uncertain about an answer. Letters entered in the default pen mode are black, while letters entered in pencil mode are gray.</p>
<p>When solving a puzzle in the app, tap the pen icon to switch from one mode to the other. When solving a puzzle online, select the pen icon for pen mode and the pencil icon for pencil mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/pen_pencil.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="108"> </p>
<p><strong>18. What do the colors in The Crossword indicate?</strong></p>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">Letters entered in the default pen mode are black, while letters entered in pencil mode are gray. Letters that have been confirmed with <strong>Check</strong> are blue. Letters that have been revealed to be inaccurate with <strong>Check</strong> are red. These will return to the default color if you change an incorrect letter to a new one. However, a gray flag will remain on the square. A red flag will remain on the square if letters are revealed to be inaccurate with <strong>Reveal</strong>.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>A clue will turn gray after you have entered all letters; this applies whether you are right or wrong. </p>
<p><strong>19. How do I use the clock?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV"> The clock is displayed by default in the app. You can hide it by switching <strong>Show Clock</strong> in the puzzle settings menu to <strong>Off</strong>. When you visit The Crossword online, you can click <strong>Show Clock </strong>to display it and <strong>Hide</strong> to remove it. If you clear the entire puzzle, your clock will restart. </div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>20. How do I enter symbols and numbers in the app?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">There is a separate keyboard in the app for symbols and numbers. To switch to it, tap the button in the lower left corner of your screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/symbol_keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="144"></p>
<p>To switch back to the standard keyboard, tap the ABC button.</p>
<p><strong>21. Can I change my user name for The Crossword?</strong></p>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">Currently, you can’t change your user name.</div>
<div class="element2">  </div>
<div class="element2"><strong>22. What is the My Statistics page? How do I access it?</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2">We currently offer basic statistics about puzzles solved and streaks in the iOS app and on the web and mobile web pages. You can view your puzzle statistics with an accompanying bar graph on the My Statistics page.  We are looking to revamp statistics in the future and will bring this new stats to all platforms.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will need iOS app version 2.5.0 or later of the app to view the My Statistics page. </p>
<p><strong>23. How do I interpret my statistics? How are they calculated?</strong></p>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">The My Statistics page contains your puzzle statistics (Puzzles Solved, Solve Rate, Current Streak and Longest Streak) with an accompanying bar graph.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>The number of Puzzles Solved reflects the number of puzzles solved whether you used Check or Reveal. The Solve Rate is the number of puzzles solved (whether or not using Check or Reveal) over the number of puzzles attempted. Streaks reflect the number of consecutive Crossword puzzles solved before midnight on their publication dates (Eastern time) without using Check or Reveal.</p>
<p>In the bar graph, the current day features three colored bars. The blue bar indicates your average solve time for this day of the week, the pink bar indicates your solve time for the most recent puzzle solved on this day of the week and the yellow bar indicates your best solve time for this day of the week.</p>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/crossword_my_statistics.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other days of the week have one blue bar with three colored dots. Blue dots (labeled with A) indicate your average solve time for that day of the week. Pink dots (labeled with T) indicate your solve time for the most recent puzzle completed on that day of the week. Yellow dots (labeled with B) indicate your best solve time for that day of the week.</p>
<p>Please note that using Check or Reveal disqualifies that puzzle's solve time from the Scorecard and from the My Statistics Page.  </p>
<div class="summary">
<p><strong>24. What keyboard shortcuts are available online?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="opposingFloatControl wrap insetV">
<div class="element2">You can use the following keyboard shortcuts.</div>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>You can move the cursor left, right, up or down with the arrow keys. You can also switch from Across mode to Down mode with the up or down keys and from Down mode to Across mode with the left or right keys. You can jump to the next clue the tab key or to the previous clue with the shift key and the tab key. You can press <strong>Escape</strong> to enter Rebus mode or <strong>Backspace </strong>to clear the current square (if filled) or the previous square.</p>
<p>You can also customize the behavior of these keys in Account Settings. </p>
<p><strong>25. What can I do if the puzzle is too small?  Can I make it bigger in the app?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>There are two ways to adjust the puzzle in the app if you are having difficulty viewing it:</p>
<ol>
<li>In our iOS and Android apps, you can pinch open to zoom in on the puzzle.</li>
<li>You can also switch to a Clue View in which clues are presented in list form. To switch to Clue View, tap the icon in the top right corner of your screen. To switch back to a standard view, tap the icon again.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/membercenter/help/crosswords/clue_view.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="119"></p>
<p>When solving the puzzle online, you can use your browser’s built-in zoom feature to increase the size of the puzzle. </p>

<div class="element2"><strong>32. Is digital Daily Spelling Bee puzzle different from the Spelling Bee in the Sunday paper?</strong><br>The daily digital Spelling Bee puzzle is not the same puzzle that you find in The New York Times Sunday Magazine.  The digital version uses different letters than what is published in the magazine.  The digital version allows you to find four-letter words and has a slightly different scoring system.  The daily Spelling Bee puzzle is only available to crossword puzzle subscribers and a new puzzle is made available each day at 3am ET</div>
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2"><strong>33. Why isn't every word in Spelling Bee?</strong></div>
<div class="element2">Every Spelling Bee puzzle is hand-curated to focus on relatively common words (with a couple tough ones here and there to keep it challenging). Occasionally we'll miss some common words and will add them in, but our puzzle editors ultimately draw from our internal lexicon and make the call for what's best with that day's puzzle.
<p>The key word here is 'common'. We just remove words from Spelling Bee that we believe are not common enough, despite them being defined words, in order to maintain a level-field for all of our solvers. We also try to avoid terms that are  very specific to any professional field, such as terms that might be familiar to, for example, a physician, ornithologist or geologist, but not to people outside of that field of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>34. Does Letter Boxed use the same word list that Spelling Bee does?</strong><br>Letter Boxed is based on words in the <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford University Press English Dictionary</a>. Spelling Bee has a separate curated word list that strives to incorporate commonly used words, with a couple challenging words from time-to-time. The daily Letter Boxed puzzle is only available to crossword puzzle subscribers and a new puzzle is made available each day at 3am ET.</p>
</div>
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2"><strong>35. Can I access the Spelling Bee or Letter Boxed from the Crossword app?</strong></div>
<div class="element2">We have not added Spelling Bee or Letter Boxed to the Crossword app because we 1) want to make the crossword app singular in its focus and 2) we are contemplating making a separate app for these other games. But in the interim, we can help you create a desktop icon on your phone that will provide you an app-like experience by taking the following steps:</div>
<div class="element2"> </div>
<div class="element2"><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360002763066/Screen_Shot_2018-10-23_at_3.36.25_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2018-10-23_at_3.36.25_PM.png" width="195" height="132"><br><br>On iOS:</div>
<ol>
<li class="element2">go to <a class="twitter-timeline-link" title="http://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee" href="https://t.co/RmU8m7aHj5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="js-display-url">nytimes.com/puzzles/spelli</span><span class="invisible">ng-bee</span></a> in Safari,</li>
<li class="element2">at the bottom of the screen select the share icon,</li>
<li class="element2">then in bottom roll scroll over to the "Add to Home Screen" icon - you're done!</li>
</ol>
<p>On Android: </p>

<li>press the Menu button (either below the screen on some devices or at top right corner of browser),</li>
<li>then tap on Page,</li>
<li>then tap Add Page Shortcut - viola!</li>
</ol>
<p>The same process can be done for Letter Boxed (<a href="https://nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed">https://nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed</a>)<br><br>FYI - If you've purchased your crossword subscription through iTunes or Android, be sure you've created an account with the NYTimes within the app; then you can login to the URL using same ID and password for Spelling Bee and we'll recognize you have access.</p>

<p><strong>36. What is Across Lite? </strong></p>
<p><span>Across Lite is a 3rd Party application created by <a href="http://www.litsoft.com/">Litsoft</a> (not developed or supported by The New York Times) that makes use of raw .puz files. This software was an option some users used before we had created our iOS, Android, desktop and mobile web versions that have even more features to support solving (as well as displaying specific creative assets for our special puzzles).  <br><br>Only the web and mobile web are able to distribute .puz files.  These can be downloaded by going to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/archive">Archive</a> and choose the list view (instead of calendar view) and you will see a link to Across Lite next to each puzzle.  Clicking on this link will download the file to your computer.  For support for Across Lite, please contact litsoftnyt@litsoft.com.</span></p>
