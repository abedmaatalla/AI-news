One factor keeping away the crowds: lack of easy access. Up until now, the nearest airport has been more than a two-hour drive away, in Puerto Vallarta. But that will change with the planned opening of the Chalacatepec Airport in the second half of this year, which will cut travel time by more than half. And a clutch of luxury hotels will soon follow &#x2014; including 10 from the AMResorts group that will open in the area in the next two years. For now, the best luxury option is the <a href=\"https://www.slh.com/hotels/las-alamandas-resort/\">Las Alamandas Resort</a>, set on a 1,500-acre nature reserve, with just 16 suites in seven brightly painted casitas, as well as two restaurants, a spa and a large pool.
