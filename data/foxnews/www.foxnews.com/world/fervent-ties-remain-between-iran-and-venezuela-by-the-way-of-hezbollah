The Iranian government wanted to use Venezuela to make bicycles. A little crazy,&#x201D; Venezuelan opposition leader Julio Borges, who has been living in exile in the Colombian capital of Bogota for the past 10&#xA0;months, told Fox News in an interview. &#x201C;Hezbollah enjoys a kind of impunity in Venezuela too.&#xA0;They get Venezuelan documents and passports. And they can live and operate freely on the East side of the country.&#x201D;</p><p>Investigations in recent years have also revealed Venezuelan officials have directed schemes to sell passports to foreigners in the Middle East. In 2015 testimony given by an adviser to the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq, Misael Lopez Soto, the government is alleged to have delivered diplomatic documents to terrorists in the Middle East. Embassy employees were also said to have sold visas, passports, identity cards and Venezuelan birth certificates to those in the region who can pay between $5,000 and $15,000.</p><p>Moises Rendon, associate director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Americas Program, also pointed out to Fox News that links between Iran and Venezuela remain potent and have long been cemented &#x2013; with the murky mystery of Iran Air flights still unsolved. &#x201C;There was a direct flight daily from Caracas to Tehran.&#xA0;No one really knew what was on those airplanes,&#x201D; Rendon said. &#x201C;There was no transparency.&#x201D;</p><p>The &#x201C;mystery&#x201D; flight that shuttled between Venezuela, Syria, and Iran for three years &#x2013; which was listed as a commercial route, yet no tickets were available for purchase without government vetting &#x2013; was abruptly canned in 2010, amid a growing chorus of accusations that it was being used to move&#xA0;spies, terrorist and deadly cargo among the persona non grata nations.</p><p>There has also been close military cooperation among Venezuela, Iran and Hezbollah. Beginning around 2012, Iran&#x2019;s elite counter-terrorism unit, the Quds Force, started ramping up its irregular warfare Latin America training program &#x2013; often using Hezbollah operatives to train both the Venezuela military and Colombia&#x2019;s FARC rebels. Quds Force-based operatives were also believed to be placed inside Iranian embassies and within religious institutions.</p><p>The Quds Force was especially present within Venezuela&#x2019;s National Guard,&#xA0;&#x201C;providing assistance to the regime for keeping the opposition at bay,&#x201D; according to analysts. The group also targeted youth of Muslim&#xA0;origin for recruitment.</p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1470/828/35b5781092394e47b7bc864b4efcfb20-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1862/1048/35b5781092394e47b7bc864b4efcfb20-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/35b5781092394e47b7bc864b4efcfb20-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="Iraq's elite counterterrorism forces inspect defenses after regaining control of the Quds neighborhood of Mosul, Iraq, Monday, Jan. 2, 2017.

Dozens of recruits are also sent to Iran, rotating in groups of 10-20 every two to three months, according to Obdola.</p><p>In a video viewed by Fox News, ostensible relatives of Iran&#x2019;s Mohsen Rabbani can be seen &#x201C;sending a message to Venezuelan followers&#x201D; in Spanish, which is alleged to be part of the inter-country training. Rabbani has been accused of being the mastermind behind the 1994 AMIA terrorist attack on the Jewish community in Argentina that killed 85 people.</p><p>Venezuela has also long been deemed a facilitator to assist Iran in evading sanctions &#x2013; with the two countries coordinating to develop an array of business enterprises, financial institutions and religious foundations to launder Iranian money and solicit technology &#x2013; dating bate to the Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad days.</p><p>A crucial pillar of the relationship was to spread anti-American sentiment across Latin America. Yet tensions between Venezuela and neighboring countries like&#xA0;Colombia have long been at odds over Venezuela&#x2019;s suspected sanctions-evading support for Iran, especially through weapons exports and trades between the countries.</p><p>A year earlier, U.S. intelligence reports indicated the two governments had established a &#x201C;National Geoscience Database&#x201D; with the intention to survey mineral deposits in Venezuela, prompting alarm it could be the restart of a uranium program.

While sanctions against Iran were reinstated last year after President Trump pulled the U.S out of the JCPOA, better known as the Iran Deal, Venezuela faced&#xA0;an increasing number of sanctions as the country&apos;s economy&#xA0; continued&#xA0;to crumble.</p><p>Around 2009, Venezuela is also said to have started offering Iran contracts to build low-income housing, even though the tenders coming from within Venezuela&#x2019;s own private sector were half the cost.

According to one Venezuelan intel source, Aissami &#x2013; born to a Lebanese mother and Syrian father &#x2013; is one of the wealthiest men in the country, and for years has been under investigation by U.S. prosecutors for having close connections to Hezbollah and financing from their drug trafficking.</p><p>Aissami remained in the second-in-command role until June of 2018, when he was shuffled to the position of Minister of Industries and National Production. But &#x201C;Tareck is the most powerful official of the Venezuelan regime in charge of all the support, financing and expansion of Hezbollah in the Hemisphere,&#x201D; Obdola said.</p><p>There are others said to be involved in the Venezuela-Iran connection.&#xA0;Aissami&apos;s brother, Feras El Aissami,&#xA0;is believed to have moved to Uruguay last year, closer to the coveted &#x201C;tri-border&#x201D; area for drug trafficking operations.</p><p>Then there is <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/ghazi-nasr-al-din" target="_blank">Ghazi Nasr Al-Din</a>, a Lebanese national who became a Venezuelan citizen in 1998. He is wanted by the FBI for questioning regarding his alleged &#x201C;fundraising efforts&#x201D; with Hezbollah contributors. Al-Din, a former Venezuelan diplomat who served in their Syrian embassy, reportedly met with Hezbollah officials in Lebanon to &#x201C;discuss operational issues,&#x201D; beginning around 2006. Al-Din reportedly also sought donations for Hezbollah, and announced the opening of a Hezbollah-sponsored community center and office in Venezuela, according to the FBI. He later moved on to the Venezuelan embassy in Beirut.</p><p>Some Venezuelan intelligence experts say relations between the two countries &#x201C;peaked&#x201D; during the reigns of Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &#x2013; both of who were out of office by 2013. But Iran is said to have affirmed its stronghold in Venezuela in the years since.</p><p>Victor Mr. Mijares, a Venezuelan political scientist and assistant professor of political science of Los Andes University, Colombia, said the Iran-Venezuela relationship went through its &#x201C;golden age&#x201D; in the last years of Chavez&#x2019;s life, which ended almost six years ago. According to Mijares, both Chavez and Ahmedinejad&#xA0;shared &#x201C;common geopolitical objectives, and identified the United States as the main enemy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After Chavez&#x2019;s death, the relationship cooled down. But today, Iran remains an important ally of Venezuela in Eurasia and within OPEC, but its ties with China and Russia have been strengthened, and now Turkey is becoming much more important to the Maduro regime,&#x201D; Mijares said. &#x201C;But it is in the interest of the Venezuelan government to disassociate itself from the West and from Latin America, turning Venezuela into a Eurasian enclave in the Americas and thus not be punished by the diplomatic and economic hemispheric mechanisms. Hezbollah is supposed to be an ally in reaching that goal.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuela-crisis-families-cannot-afford-proper-funerals" target="_blank">IN VENEZUELAN CRISIS, FAMILIES CAN&apos;T EVEN AFFORD TO PROPERLY BURY THE DEAD</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombias-peace-agreement-bloodied-by-distrust-drugs-and-the-venezuelan-regime" target="_blank">COLOMBIA&#x2019;S PEACE AGREEMENT BLOODIED BY DISTRUST, DRUGS - AND THE VENEZUELAN REGIME</a></p><p>Indeed, other areas of Latin America, outside of Venezuela, have interacted with Hezbollah.</p><p>In December, Deputy U.S Secretary of State John Sullivan <a href="https://www.state.gov/s/d/2018/288014.htm" target="_blank">cautioned</a> that several Latin American countries are being forced to face &#x201C;regular&#x201D; terror plots at the behest of Hezbollah.
