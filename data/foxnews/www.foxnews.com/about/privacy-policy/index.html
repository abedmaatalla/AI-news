<a name="intro"></a>

<h3>1) Scope and Application</h3>

<p>Fox News Network, LLC ("Fox News" or "we" or “our”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected, used or shared through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "Fox News Services") (unless a different policy is provided on a particular website or app, in which case such different policy shall control data collected through that particular website or app). By using Fox News Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies ("Company Affiliates") is available at <a href="//www.21cf.com">www.21cf.com</a>.</p>

<p>As set forth in our <a href="//www.foxnews.com/about/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>, the Fox News Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox News Services without being registered with [or subscribing to] a Fox News Service and those who have registered with [or subscribed to] a Fox News Service. This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>

<p>By providing personal information to us and/or using the Fox News Services, you unconditionally consent and agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. <strong>If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Fox News Services.</strong></p>
<a name="collection"></a>

<h3>2) Collection of Information</h3>

<p>Fox News and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:</p>

<p><strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information you submit to register for a Fox News Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday. Fox News may allow for multiple profiles to be set up under one account. If this occurs, we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.</p>

<p><strong>Other Voluntarily Provided Information.</strong> Fox News may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences, contact Fox News through customer service or by other means, or participate in promotions that Fox News may offer from time to time. Fox News also may collect information you provide to use when you place an order on a Fox News Service. This information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new website features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this Fox News Services. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information, information regarding your interests or similar information. Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Fox News Services’ features.</p>

<p><strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox News Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>

<p><strong>Information from Social Media.</strong> If you access or log-in to a Fox News Service through a social media service or connect a Fox News Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Fox News Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox News Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox News to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Activity Information.</strong> When you access and interact with the Fox News Services, Fox News and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox News Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox News Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. These technologies are discussed below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data.

<ul class="sub">
<li>
<strong>Opt-Out of Promotional Communications:</strong> If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email. Please note that you cannot opt out from receiving all communications from Fox News, including administrative messages, service announcements, and messages regarding the terms and conditions of your account because those may contain important information.</li>

We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</li>
	<li>
<strong><u>Additional Choices for California Residents</u></strong>
	<ul>
<li>If you are a California resident, you may be entitled to request certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information (such as your name and contact information) to third parties who wish to contact you or send you promotional information about their products and services directly (as compared to when the third party is acting on our behalf or you have provided your personal information as part of a co-promotion by Fox News and the third party). If you are a California resident and would like to request a copy of information regarding our disclosure to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, please send us a letter at Fox News, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York NY 10036, Attn: Legal Department.</li>

<h3>6) Other Important Information</h3>

<p><strong>Updates to Privacy Policy.</strong> Fox News may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law or the Fox News Services or for other reasons. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Fox News Services.</p>

<p><strong>Location of Data.</strong> The Fox News Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information (which may include information collected through the use of cookies and other technologies, as described above) processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Linked Services.</strong> The Fox News Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Fox News is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Fox News Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.</p>

<p>In addition, Fox News is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Fox News Services.</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</strong> In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>

<p><strong>Data Retention.</strong> We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>

<p>Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, or contractual, financial or legal requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Fox News Services or otherwise. Your use of the Fox News Services is at your own risk. Fox News urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your account, and closing your web browser. In order to help us protect your sensitive further, you should be careful about providing your password to others.</p>

<p>Whenever you give Fox News sensitive or confidential information, Fox News will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. Fox News uses an industry standard security protocol for encrypting sensitive information. Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Fox News and you do so at your own risk.</p>
