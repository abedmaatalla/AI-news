Both men were Methodists.</p><p>But in an unpublished manuscript by Jackie that is featured in Ed Henry&#x2019;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/42-Faith-Jackie-Robinson-Story/dp/0718088808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548595798&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=42+faith" target="_blank">&#x201C;42 Faith,&#x201D;</a> Robinson himself talks repeatedly about something much deeper that led him to success &#x2013; an almost divine intervention that helped him defy the odds.</p><blockquote class="pull-quote"><p class="quote-text">Robinson’s faith served as a source of inspiration and motivation, comfort and strength, wisdom and direction. It was the engine that drove and sustained him as he shattered racial barriers on and off the baseball diamond.</p><!----></blockquote><p>&#x201C;Somebody else might have ... done a better job,&#x201D; Robinson wrote. &#x201C;But God and Branch Rickey made it possible for me to be the one, and I just went on in and did the best I knew how.&#x201D;</p><p>Jackie&#x2019;s story of faith began when Mallie Robinson left her philandering husband behind in rural Georgia. She moved her children to Pasadena, California when Jackie was 6-months-old, hoping to escape the oppressive bigotry of the Jim Crow South.</p><p>But discrimination existed everywhere, and young Jackie was infuriated by it. On top of that, he was being raised by a single mom, and he was going down the wrong path. He joined a gang in Pasadena and got involved in fistfights and scrapes with the law, prompted by racial antagonism.</p><p>And then one day, a young minister at the Scott United Methodist Church in Pasadena, Rev. Karl Downs, intervened. He told Jackie that all of his athletic talents would go to waste if he didn&#x2019;t make a clean break from the gang. Rev. Downs sparked nothing short of a spiritual awakening in Jackie; he became a father figure and brought Jackie back into the church. </p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1470/828/2-barrier-1949.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1862/1048/2-barrier-1949.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/2-barrier-1949.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="Two years after becoming the first African-American to play in the Major Leagues, Jackie Robinson (far left) along with Larry Doby, Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella became the first African-Americans to appear in an All-Star Game"></picture></div><div class="caption"><p>

While playing for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues, Jackie openly scorned his whiskey-drinking and promiscuous teammates, once tossing a glass of scotch into a lighted fireplace to demonstrate how lethal liquor is. He also stunned some of his teammates by declaring that he was waiting until he was married to have sex.</p><p>But Robinson and Rickey were a perfect match. Rickey&#x2019;s religious devotion was such that he didn&apos;t even attend Dodgers games on Sundays after making a solemn promise to his own mother many years earlier. She was worried there was too much sin around the game, so in exchange for allowing Rickey to pursue his dream of first playing and then serving as an MLB executive, he would never step foot in a ballpark on Sunday to keep his focus on the Lord.</p><p>When the two men first met at the Dodgers offices in the summer of 1945, Rickey told Robinson that he wanted to sign the 26-year-old ballplayer. But for Robinson to succeed, Rickey said, he couldn&apos;t respond to the indignities that would be piled on him. &quot;I&apos;m looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back.&quot;</p><p>Rickey then opened a book published in the 1920s, Giovanni Papini&apos;s &quot;Life of Christ,&quot; and read Jesus&apos; words: &quot;But whoever shall smite thee on the cheek, turn to him the other also.&quot;</p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1470/828/Robinson-Day-Baseball-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1862/1048/Robinson-Day-Baseball-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/Robinson-Day-Baseball-1.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="FILE - In this June 30, 1971, file photo, Jackie Robinson poses at his home in Stamford, Conn."></picture></div><div class="caption"><p>
