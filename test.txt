For Texas state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, requiring people to use the bathroom according to the gender on their birth certificate has always been about public safety.', 'It’s why Kolkhorst is\xa0the prime sponsor of a controversial transgender bathroom bill —\xa0the Texas Privacy Act —\xa0being debated in the Legislature, and why she welcomed news Wednesday that the Trump administration had ceased a federal mandate, implemented by President Obama, directing schools to allow transgender students to use restrooms and other facilities that match their gender identities.', '“I am grateful,” Kolkhorst said in a statement. “The people of Texas must define for ourselves what boundaries are expected in our public facilities.”', 'Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a staunch supporter of her bill, also lauded the move, calling the legislation prudent, not discriminatory as critics have charged. “It is a common-sense, privacy and public safety policy for everyone,” he said.', 'Similar legislation backed primarily by Republicans in\xa0a dozen states\xa0would require people to use the bathroom based on the gender on their birth certificate, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\xa0In the Trump administration’s decision, it said the issue of bathroom access is one that should be left to the states.', 'The administration’s move has buoyed the hopes of supporters of so-called bathroom bills, but they still face opposition in many states, even conservative ones.', 'It cost North Carolina jobs\xa0and revenue as business and sports leagues launched boycotts. But that hasn’t deterred Texas.', 'Top Republicans there now want to follow North Carolina and ban transgender people from using the bathrooms of the gender they identify with.\xa0', 'This week state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst,...', 'It cost North Carolina jobs\xa0and revenue as business and sports leagues launched boycotts. But that hasn’t deterred Texas.', 'Top Republicans there now want to follow North Carolina and ban transgender people from using the bathrooms of the gender they identify with.\xa0', 'This week state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst,...', 'Obama’s guidelines, which were announced in May, required schools to treat transgender students according to their stated gender identity, and either allow access to restrooms and locker rooms for the gender they identify with or provide private facilities if requested. Obama’s attorney general, Loretta Lynch, had argued\xa0that students’ gender identities were protected under Title IX requirements, which prohibit federally funded schools from discriminating on the basis of sex.', 'Those guidelines received strong pushback as several states filed lawsuits arguing, among other things, that they\xa0hindered operations in public schools. A federal judge had issued a temporary injunction in December, essentially stalling the rules.', 'The Trump administration framed the issue as one of states’ rights.\xa0In\xa0a statement, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions\xa0said state legislatures and local governments\xa0“are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue.” \xa0', 'The Justice Department, he added, is “committed to the proper interpretation and enforcement of Title IX and to its protections for all students, including LGBTQ students, from discrimination, bullying, and harassment.”', 'On Thursday, Sean Spicer, President Trump’s press secretary, reiterated the administration’s view that states should be left to make their own legislation on transgender bathroom access.', '“The president obviously understands the issue and the challenges\xa0[that] especially young children face,” he said. “He just believes that this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by states.”', 'For Trump, commenting on social issues — such as same-sex marriage, abortion or transgender rights — has never seemed much of a priority.', 'Indeed, throughout his campaign, Trump hardly discussed the topics.', 'When asked about transgender bathroom access at a town hall last April,\xa0Trump said people should be able to use whichever bathroom they choose. In a follow-up interview days later, he said the issue should be left up to the states.', 'Opponents of bathroom laws have assailed the measures as discriminatory. Among the notables denouncing the move was Jackie Evancho, who sang at the president’s inauguration. Evancho, who has a transgender sister, wrote on Twitter:', '"@realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me &amp my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts."', 'She also tweeted: “I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove."', 'Some Republican governors have called bathroom bills unnecessary. Govs. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Matt Bevin of Kentucky have said they won’t support such legislation.', 'Some opposition to bathroom bills stems from the experience of North Carolina. After it became\xa0the first state to have such a law when it was passed last March, corporations, sports leagues and artists boycotted holding events in the state. Charlotte, the state’s largest city, lost nearly $100 million when the NBA moved its All-Star Game this year to New Orleans, city officials estimated.', 'In Texas, the nonpartisan Texas Assn. of Business conducted a study on the potential economic impact Kolkhorst’s measure would have on the state, concluding that it could cost between $964 million and\xa0$8.5 billion in the first year, with tourism taking a large hit.', 'Yet this has not deterred lawmakers in other states. This week, ahead of the Trump administration’s announcement, Missouri state Sen. Ed Emery, who is sponsoring a bathroom bill in his state, castigated the Obama-era mandates.', '“It certainly changes the dynamic,” Emery said of Trump’s move. “We don’t feel threatened by the federal government anymore.” \xa0', 'Sarah McBride, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates and seeks expansion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender\xa0rights nationwide, called the rescinding of Obama’s directive disgraceful.', '“This was life-saving guidance that protected transgender kids,” said McBride, who herself is a transgender woman. “This is all very disheartening and is a bad signal for transgender people all across the country.”', 'Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said that “there are some lawmakers emboldened by” Trump’s move. But she thinks bathroom bills can still be defeated. “Many Texans and people around the country understand gender identity,” she said, adding, “we’ve got to keep educating.”\xa0', 'Legal issues continue to swirl around bathroom bills. The\xa0Supreme Court is\xa0scheduled to consider a case about a transgender boy who wants to use the boys’ bathroom at a Virginia high school.', 'Gavin Grimm\xa0won his case in lower courts, citing the guidelines issued by the Obama administration. In the fall, the Supreme Court decided it would hear the school district’s appeal to the lower court ruling.', 'Attorneys for the school board in Gloucester County,\xa0about 50 miles north of Norfolk, noted in their appeal that\xa0government regulations say they can have “separate toilet, locker rooms and shower facilities on the basis of sex.”\xa0', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

One half expects the ghosts of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to swirl\xa0across the silver skyline rising inside the Dolby Theatre for Sunday’s 89th Academy Awards. The stage set glitters\xa0with more than 300,000 Swarovski crystals and is an homage to the sly and urbane musicals of the 1930s.', 'Production designer Derek McLane says\xa0the sets were inspired by the Art Deco and Hollywood Regency styles that resonated in films such as “The Broadway Melody” and “Top Hat,”\xa0the 1935 musical starring Astaire and Rogers. The stage evokes\xa0the sensation of wandering in a tux and tails through a metropolis on a starry, if misty, night. The award show’s producers, Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, wanted a look that would summon the past with flair and elegance.', '“They really felt that we ought to have something that was happy and delightful, maybe a little escapist so you could look at it and say, ‘This will be fun,’” says\xa0McLane, a trim man with a flop of hair and a scarf. He’s been the production designer on five Academy Award ceremonies. “There’s a little nostalgia, and it’s a real tribute to what’s fun about Hollywood.”', 'That\xa0wink to the fabled, bygone days of the film industry comes amid a nation riven by anxiousness and political acrimony. \xa0The movies of Astaire and Rogers were a salve, a bit of witty fantasy sparkling with sequins and martinis, for a land enduring the Great Depression. That sense of glamour will decorate Sunday’s\xa0ceremony, where the nominated films speak to America’s current complicated dimensions: from the whimsical “La La Land” to the starker racial narratives of “Fences” and “Moonlight.”\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0', 'McLane, who spends much of his time designing theater productions on Broadway and around the world, says\xa0a live show is a balancing of images and a promise of the\xa0unexpected.', '“You want enough visual variety so that it stays interesting and surprising,” he says, adding that over the years he’s learned how to design for a stage that is on view from all angles:\xa0“I hadn’t realized the extent to which the camera sees the backside of the scenery. The show is becoming more and more 360 degrees” with ever-present roving cameras.', 'Pivoting LED screens were placed in the wings, he says, “so you feel there’s a continuous environment all the way around.” Much of that view is pointillist and bright.\xa0Crystal —\xa0as if a giant champagne glass has\xa0shattered —\xa0glints\xa0no matter where the cameras point: 80,000 crystals in the 80-foot-by-40-foot curtain, and 23,500 crystals gracing the theater’s 18 opera boxes. \xa0', 'The other day, as stage hands worked and sets were moved about, the theater, for a moment, fell quiet except for the hum of a vacuum cleaner moving through rows beneath the crystals. McLane’s work was nearly done.\xa0The moment the show starts, his sketches and renderings will be put aside: “I literally sit in the audience and watch and keep my fingers crossed,” he says. “By then, we’ve turned it over to the stage managers and the crew.”\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0', '\xa0', 'See the most-read stories this hour »', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

Nevada state Sen.\xa0Pat Spearman knew her resolution was 35 years late. But that wasn’t the point.', 'The resolution called on Nevada to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which came close to becoming part of the U.S. Constitution, but never did because fewer than three-quarters of the states ratified it by the 1982 deadline set by Congress. It needed three more states.', 'Spearman, a Democrat, had sponsored the same resolution two years ago, when Republicans controlled the Legislature and a committee voted it down. But she pushed on.', 'On Wednesday at 3:59 p.m. — Spearman checked the time — the same committee voted 4 to 1 to send the resolution to the full senate.', 'If Nevada goes on to ratify the ERA, it would be the first state to do so since 1982. Ratification would also be at least a symbolic victory for people who believe the rights of women should be enshrined in the Constitution.', 'The ERA is short, with the heart of it reading: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”', 'It was first proposed in the 1920s, but Congress didn’t pass it until 1972. Then the 1982 deadline for ratification by 38 states expired.', 'That defeat was due in large part to the efforts of the Eagle Forum, a conservative lobbying group, and its\xa0founder, Phyllis Schlafly, who warned that ratification would lead to women being drafted, an idea that President Carter\xa0floated in his 1980 State of the Union address.', 'Some feminists also attributed the outcome to the dominance of men in business and politics.', 'Since the early 1990s, supporters of the amendment have been trying to get three of the 15 state legislatures that rejected it to reverse course.', 'In Virginia, one chamber approved ratification while the other refused on multiple occasions. Illinois had a similar scenario play out in 2014.', 'Currently, Nevada is one of eight states with resolutions calling for ratification. In six of those states — Utah, Arizona, Missouri, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina — at least one house of the legislature is controlled by Republicans, who have opposed the idea.', 'In Arizona, where Republicans control both houses, Pamela Powers Hannley, a Democratic state representative who is sponsoring the resolution there, said it can’t get a legislative hearing.', 'Republicans “know what will happen if it gets to a floor debate,” she said. “They’ll have to explain to their wives, sisters and daughters why they don’t deserve equal pay. They don’t want to have to do that.”', 'She said her state should look to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor as a “role model.” Before becoming the first woman on the court, O’Connor served two terms in the Arizona Legislature and supported the ERA.', 'Utah state Sen. Jim Dabakis said his resolution in that state’s GOP-dominated Legislature was also unlikely to get out of a committee, but he said he hoped Nevada could become the 36th state and start the movement over again.', '“This is one case where I hope what happens in Nevada doesn’t stay in Nevada,” Dabakis said.', 'In Nevada, where the November election gave Democrats full control of the Legislature, lawmakers appear to be forging ahead.', 'Senate President Aaron Ford says that “this go-around, equal rights will be ratified in Nevada.” House Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson says that passage of the amendment is a priority and that Democrats are “doubling down on the notion we stand for equal rights.”', 'Last week, a State Senate committee held a hearing before a packed chamber in the Capitol and took testimony by video feed from Las Vegas in what seemed like a time capsule from the 1970s. Members of the public wore iconic green-and-white buttons reading “ERA yes.”', 'Marlene Lockhard, representing the Nevada Women’s Lobby, read remarks made in 1975 by Sue Wagner, who at the time was a Republican member of the State Assembly and had pushed for ratification:', '“It has been difficult for me to accept the fact that I must stand here … 200 years since the founding of this country and debate an issue so basic, so just, so fair and so American as legal rights for all. But I must and I shall for as long as it is necessary.”', 'One Nevada resident, Leslie Sexton, testified that her mother chose her name for a pragmatic reason: On paper, Leslie could be the name of either a man or woman.', '“If my name ever appeared on a list, I might have a better chance of equality or being chosen for something," Sexton said. “Back then, a female name automatically meant you went to the bottom — or lower than men.”', 'Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said in an interview that Nevada could set the table for action on the ERA and that the push is driven by the current political climate.', '“I think what is really going on is women in this country are extremely energized,” O’Neill said. “Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million, and part of the reason she won is she ran a proudly feminist and inclusive campaign.”', 'Some experts have argued that Congress could set a new deadline for ratification of the ERA if the states show interest.', 'The Constitution could also be amended through a national convention. But changing the supreme law of the land is not easy. Of the 11,699 attempts\xa0as of the beginning of this year, it has been amended 27 times.', 'Jeffrey Abramson, a professor of law and government at the University of Texas, said that he doubted the current Republican-controlled Congress would propose a new ERA but that the push to ratify could be a rallying cry for the midterm election.', 'The massive turnout at the Women’s March after the inauguration of President Trump last month suggests that a revived ERA would have significant support by the states, he said.', 'But the ERA still faces steadfast opposition, including from some women.', 'Echoing Schlafly, who died last year, Janine Hansen of the Nevada Eagle Forum said ratification would lead to women being subjected to a military draft and the elimination of Social Security benefit for wives who choose to not work.', '“The feminist movement has tried to eradicate this homemaker benefit,” Hansen said. “It doesn’t fit into the mantra that every woman should be a working woman.”', 'James Settelmeyer, a Republican Nevada state senator and the sole vote against the resolution after Wednesday’s committee hearing, did not say whether he supported\xa0the ERA.', 'But efforts to revive it should start with Congress rather than states trying to ratify it decades after the deadline, he said.', '“It does no harm,” he said of the effort. “But it does no good either.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Warning that it will only amount to a small down payment on a large and costly problem, Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled a $437-million request Friday to speed up flood control efforts in Northern California and boost the readiness of\xa0the state’s emergency operations.', '“These liabilities are a serious cloud, and we have to take them seriously,”\xa0said Brown in a news conference in Sacramento.', 'The proposal, quickly stitched together by the governor’s administration as a response to a winter of pounding storms, offers up a speedier time frame for efforts that have been underway for some time. State officials had expected to complete most of the flood control work over five years, but\xa0Brown’s new proposal would do so in just two years.', '“What’s required is to take some immediate action,” the governor said.', 'Even so, the new effort does not\xa0address what Brown’s budget director said Friday is at least a $1-billion price tag for damage in the state caused by floodwaters and emergency evacuations. The crisis at the Oroville Dam\xa0—\xa0and the damage to the facility’s main and backup\xa0spillways —\xa0offered a glimpse\xa0at\xa0California’s\xa0hidden public works problems. Usage of the backup spillway caused extensive erosion, which later threatened to take a huge bite out of the side of the reservoir and forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people.', 'The crisis eased after dam managers were able to lower the lake’s level. But interviews and records\xa0suggest that the near-catastrophe grew out of\xa0fundamental problems with the original design of the emergency spillway that were never corrected despite questions about the design’s\xa0adequacy.', 'Brown said Friday that\xa0he was satisfied with the response by state water officials to the Oroville emergency. And while he said additional efforts will be undertaken to better understand what happened, he cautioned against demanding guarantees when dealing with the impacts of severe weather.', '“There will be problems we will not live a trouble-free existence,”\xa0Brown said.', 'The government misjudged the strength of Oroville\'s emergency spillway »', 'The governor’s proposal seeks approval from the Legislature to accelerate $387 million of borrowing\xa0authorized by\xa0Proposition 1, a $7.1-billion water bond approved by voters in 2014. While the specific projects won’t be identified until later, the effort would focus on enhanced protection in areas with significant flood risk. That includes sites across the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.', 'An additional $50 million in the plan would be spent on emergency preparedness programs, from levee inspections to stocking up on materials needed to fight rising floodwaters. The money would come, however, at the expense of further delays in maintenance on other levee locations.', 'Those kinds of deferrals were at the heart of what may have been Brown’s most impassioned remarks at his state Capitol news conference —\xa0with several reminders that the state has accumulated a towering stack of unfunded infrastructure repairs and upgrades.', 'In all, he put the tally at $187 billion when also considering the work needed on California’s sprawling network of roads and highways.', '“Look, if we’re going to have a civilization, we’re going to pay for it,” he said. “These are big projects.\xa0And anything big today challenges the Lilliputian mind that is still operative in too many political circles.”', 'The proposal also assumes additional help from the federal government. Brown sent letters on Friday to the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, asking for\xa0additional federal dam inspections and revised reservoir operating rules that reflect the latest scientific data about storms and rainfall potential. Those letters both had a note at the bottom, scrawled in the governor’s handwriting: “This is both an urgent need and a real opportunity!”', 'Brown also sent a request to President Trump for faster-than-usual environmental review of repairs to the Oroville Dam spillways and nine transportation projects. The plea met with criticism from some environmentalists who pointed out that the Oroville concerns were first pointed out as far back as 2005.', "“Over and over again, people all along the way, who had the ability to put a halt to a very dangerous situation, didn't do anything,” said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California. She said the public review process is “part of the reason you have this ability to know what’s going on.”", 'Brown’s attempt to portray the package of flood proposals\xa0as driven by pragmatism\xa0could also be seen in his defense of its reliance on help from\xa0the Trump administration. While Brown has occasionally\xa0taken Trump\xa0to task in the early days and weeks of his presidency, the veteran governor admonished on Friday those who might view\xa0the requests as anathema to being a good Democrat.', '“We are inextricably linked to the federal government,” Brown said. “We have to, I think, walk a very thoughtful line here, seeking help that we need but also calling attention to those things we object to.”', 'Times staff writers Chris Megerian and Bettina Boxall contributed to this report.', "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", 'Sen.

Nobody wants to be Uber right now.', 'In the past month,\xa0the San Francisco ride-hailing firm faced\xa0a\xa0customer boycott\xa0and sexual harassment allegations,\xa0which\xa0have devastated\xa0employee morale\xa0and steered users away from the service. Then it was slapped with a lawsuit  Thursday, in which Waymo — Google’s self-driving car project — alleged theft of trade secrets.\xa0', 'While Uber has in the past been adept at weathering bad publicity, brand and industry analysts are less sure about the company’s ability to emerge from  the recent  damaging events unscathed, particularly since Uber has pegged its future to self-driving cars.', 'It’s a remarkable turn of events for a company that had until recently plowed through any conflict on its path.\xa0', 'The lawsuit landed\xa0as Uber tried\xa0to right itself after 200,000 customers deleted the app because its chief executive served on a council advising President Trump. It was also reeling from allegations of a former employee who last weekend accused the firm of sexual harassment and a systemic cover-up —\xa0allegations that resulted in Uber recruiting\xa0former U.S. Atty\xa0Gen.\xa0Eric Holder to launch an investigation.', 'But the Waymo lawsuit may prove the biggest of the company’s many woes.\xa0', 'The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleged that former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation in January 2016. He went on to found self-driving truck startup\xa0Otto, which was acquired by Uber in August of that year for $680 million. Levandowski now heads Uber’s self-driving car division.', 'Waymo alleges it’s a division that is  using its proprietary technology.', '“Instead of developing their own technology in this new space, Defendants stole Waymo’s long-term investments and property,” Waymo said in its complaint against Uber. In a separate blog post, Waymo wrote that it was seeking an injunction to “stop the misappropriation of our designs, return all trade secret information and cease infringing our patents.”', 'In response to the complaint, an Uber spokesperson said in a  statement that the company had “reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor, and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court. In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.”', 'In addition to punitive damages, Waymo is expected to soon file a preliminary injunction against Uber to stop the company from continuing development on self-driving cars. Uber already has vehicles equipped with self-driving technology\xa0on the road in Pennsylvania and Arizona, but they were recently banned from California for operating without proper permits.', '“This case is significant because not only does it allege a major effort to take confidential information, it alleges an effort to cover up his tracks,” said Daniel Handman, a partner at law firm Hirschfeld Kramer. “So the question for Uber is how much of this did they know, when did they know it, and what did they do about it? Because if Uber was complicit in this, that raises their level of culpability.”', 'Given the significant war chests of both companies (Alphabet has a market cap of $579 billion, while the privately held Uber has a valuation of more than $62.5 billion), a lawsuit could drag on for years and prove costly no matter its resolution.', 'Intellectual property attorneys drew comparisons between the Apple-versus-Samsung case, which took more than five years and went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Mattel-versus-Bratz case, which lasted for eight years and resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees.\xa0', 'In that time, the race to bring autonomous cars to the road won’t slow, but if Waymo is awarded a preliminary injunction against Uber, then, depending on the scope of the injunction, Uber may have to hit pause on the development of\xa0its self-driving car technology.', 'While Waymo and Uber’s\xa0battle plays out in court, brand and auto experts say  Uber now has a significant trust problem on its hands.\xa0', '“One of the biggest hurdles with self-driving cars is getting the individual in the vehicle for the first time,” said Grayson Brulte, an autonomous vehicle expert and consultant. “And the problem here is when consumers see a story about this, it’s not going to say Alphabet sues Uber, it’s going to say Alphabet sues Uber over self-driving car tech. Then consumers will go down a rabbit hole: Are Uber’s cars not safe? What do they not have that they have to steal?', '“It could set back the adoption of autonomous vehicles by years.”', 'Brand experts believe Uber may be shooting its future self in the foot when self-driving cars become mainstream.', '“What Uber should be concerned about is not the people who love them or hate them, but the people in the middle ground, the people who are on the fence, who could switch over,” said Eden Gillott Bowe, president of crisis communications firm Gillott Communications.\xa0', 'Uber claims at least an 80% share of the U.S. ride-hailing market, according to  reports. It’s also the only American ride-hailing firm to have a global footprint. Despite its dominance, though, analysts said\xa0ride-hailing is increasingly being treated as a commodity, and consumers have very little brand loyalty. When a BMW, Ford or Volvo launch\xa0their own on-demand self-driving car services, Uber will struggle to hold on to its current customers unless it gives them reason to remain loyal.', '“They have to make sure going forward that they are as transparent and honest as possible through actions,” Gillott Bowe said.\xa0', 'The company has taken steps to restore consumer trust. Chief Executive Travis Kalanick stepped down from Trump’s economic advisory panel in early February after his involvement drew widespread criticism. He also called in Holder to investigate the company’s harassment and diversity problems.', 'Which is an important start, brand experts said. But even Holder’s hiring has come under fire, with early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor alleging in an open letter to the company that those in charge of the investigation are “insiders.”', '“They are in crisis at the moment,” said John Paolini, executive creative director of branding firm Sullivan, who believes  Uber could weather this\xa0but that it won’t come easily. “When you think of an organization like Uber, which is really in its infancy, it’s like a puppy chewing up the slippers and the furniture. They’ve grown so much faster than they’ve ever imagined, and it probably feels a little out of control.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

A former Uber employee sent ripples through the tech industry on Sunday when she alleged on her personal blog\xa0that she’d been sexually harassed while working for the ride-hailing giant, and that the company’s human resources department tried to cover it up.', 'Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in a memo to employees that the blog post\xa0was the first he’d heard of the incident, and called in former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric Holder to conduct an independent investigation.\xa0Tech workers took to social media to express their shock and disgust that this was happening within their industry.', 'But two groups weren’t surprised: women who work in tech, and Silicon Valley employment attorneys such as Kelly Dermody.\xa0', '“There’s a phenomenon that happens in several industries, namely tech and financial services, where there’s a buffer around the men who are considered ‘high contributors,’ ” said Dermody, who has represented hundreds of women who work in the tech sector in gender discrimination cases. “They get to have a different set of standards, and their business success translates into them being above the law of the companies.”', 'In Silicon Valley, where companies foster the\xa0myth of the wunderkind who, despite his inexperience and immaturity, can build a multibillion-dollar product, that phenomenon is especially pronounced, Dermody said.', '“There’s this confusion between innovation and disruption and basic human decency and inclusion,” she said. “People tend to associate disruption with obnoxious, exclusive, fraternity-style culture.”', 'Although\xa0gender, race and age discrimination are known problems in the technology industry, with companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter going to great lengths to publicize efforts to diversify their workforces, the propensity of HR departments to side with “rock star” employees accused of wrongdoing is not often discussed.', 'But the kind of behavior described in the former Uber employee’s blog post is pervasive in tech, according to employment attorneys, workplace management experts, and women in the sector who in recent days have spoken out on Twitter.\xa0', 'A survey conducted in 2015 by the Elephant in the Valley found that 60% of women in tech have experienced unwanted sexual advances from a colleague. A 2008 study by the Center for Talent Innovation found that some 50% of women in the industry will leave the workplace at some point in their career because of a hostile work environment. And instances in which companies have given\xa0poorly behaved rock star\xa0employees a free pass are so common that a group of\xa0software developers last year co-authored a guide to stopping abuse in tech communities, in which their top recommendation was “no more rock stars.”', 'On Twitter, women who worked in tech said their own experiences mirrored that of\xa0Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer who authored the blog post.', 'In her post, Fowler, who joined\xa0Uber as a site reliability engineer in November 2015, alleged that her manager at the time had propositioned her. When she brought the issue to Uber’s HR team, she was told that it was the man’s first offense, so “they wouldn’t feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to.”', '“Upper management told me that he ‘was a high performer’ … and they wouldn’t feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part,” she said.', 'Her post went on to describe how multiple women complained about the same man, and each of them was told it was his “first offense.”', '“The situation escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and still nothing was done,” Fowler wrote.', 'Kalanick on Monday addressed Fowler’s allegations in a memo to employees, saying that the company would bring on Holder to conduct an independent investigation of the incidents detailed in the blog post. Uber board member Arianna Huffington flew to San Francisco on Tuesday to meet with Kalanick to discuss diversity and inclusion at Uber.\xa0', '“I view it as my responsibility to hold the leadership team’s feet to the fire on this issue,” Huffington said in a statement.', 'And as Uber goes into damage control — the company\xa0had barely put a recent controversy surrounding Kalanick’s involvement with President Trump’s economic advisory panel behind it when Fowler published her blog post — public relations experts said now is the time for other technology firms to do some soul searching before their own employees publicly air grievances.', '“It’s impossible to solve an external PR problem without first solving the internal root problem,” said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, chief operating officer of crisis PR firm Group Gordon.', 'For many start-ups, HR is an afterthought. Companies\xa0focused on rapid growth often don’t hire HR staff until much later, and those that do bring them on early tend to prioritize\xa0hiring new employees. For companies that are doubling in size year over year —\xa0which is not uncommon in the tech world —\xa0understaffed and overworked HR teams often struggle to just keep up. As a result, toxic workplace cultures can develop with little oversight, leading to situations where HR departments take the path of least resistance.\xa0\xa0', '“That’s always the fallback,” said Bernice Ledbetter, a professor of organizational theory and management at Pepperdine Graziadio School of Business and Management, who noted that when companies\xa0grow fast and make a lot of money, it’s a validation of every system they have — even those that might cause harm.\xa0', '“They tell themselves that this is how we got here, we’re making a lot of money, everyone is getting bonuses, therefore the ends justify the means,” Ledbetter said, “which never leads to good ethical outcomes.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

A Pennsylvania judge ruled Friday that only one additional woman who has accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault may testify against him in his upcoming trial, dealing a setback to the lone viable criminal case against the entertainer.', 'Prosecutors were hoping the testimony of 13 alleged victims would help persuade a jury that Cosby was guilty of assaulting another woman at his estate near Philadelphia in 2004.', 'But only one of the 13 women — known in court filings as Prior Alleged Victim Six — will be permitted to testify when the trial gets underway this spring, Judge Steven T. O’Neill said.', 'Cosby, 79, who is free on $1-million bail, is facing three counts of aggravated indecent sexual assault for a 2004 incident at his Pennsylvania home involving former Temple University basketball staff member Andrea Constand.', 'It is the only alleged instance of sexual assault — among the more than 50 women who’ve accused Cosby in interviews and civil suits — in which the statute of limitations has not expired.', 'Prosecutors, however, had argued the women’s accounts established a pattern of prior bad acts — that Cosby essentially had a method of behavior the jury should consider — as they sought to bolster their case.', 'Did Bill Cosby devise a plan to drug and rape women and secretly carry it out over the course of decades in the public eye?', 'Or is he a popular entertainer being railroaded by opportunists with stale accusations and dubious motives?', 'Lawyers laid out dramatically competing views of the comedian in...', 'Did Bill Cosby devise a plan to drug and rape women and secretly carry it out over the course of decades in the public eye?', 'Or is he a popular entertainer being railroaded by opportunists with stale accusations and dubious motives?', 'Lawyers laid out dramatically competing views of the comedian in...', 'The prosecution and Cosby’s attorneys battled in a tense two-day hearing in December. Montgomery County Dist. Atty. Kevin Steele argued that the women’s accusations demonstrated a modus operandi, and the defense team, led by Brian McMonagle, said such claims were both specious and irrelevant.', 'O’Neill did not offer a reason for the ruling. Key to the defense’s argument was that the instances occurred too long ago to adequately defend (Pennsylvania law looks at time as a factor in whether to permit such testimony). Many of the other alleged instances happened in the 1970s and 1980s, while the accusation involving Prior Alleged Victim 6 was comparatively recent the incident in question occurred in 1996.', 'According to court filings, Prior Alleged Victim No. 6 said she came to know Cosby in 1990, at age 29, and had gone to his hotel and home six years later in the hope of receiving professional advice. She claims he offered her a pill and ordered her to take it, then proceeded to violate her sexually.', 'Two years ago, the woman whose account aligns with that filing appeared at a news conference organized by Los Angeles-based attorney Gloria Allred. In an emotional statement, the woman, who identified herself only as Kacey, said she was working for Cosby’s agent when she was invited to his hotel room and given a pill, then woke up next to a naked Cosby.', '“I no longer have to feel alone with this secret,” she said in a statement as she explained her state of mind.', 'Friday’s ruling was a modest surprise to some experts, who thought Steele might prevail in getting the judge to admit the testimony of a few, but not many, of the 13 women.', '“It’s very difficult to introduce prior criminal acts,” said Dennis McAndrews, a former prosecutor and longtime legal expert in Pennsylvania. “I thought they might get more than one but not many more — something closer to three or four.”', 'NEWSLETTER: Get the day\'s top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj »', 'The testimony of other accusers is considered crucial to the case. Many experts believe Constand’s testimony on its own is legally vulnerable because of her delay in coming forward and several inconsistencies in her account, which the defense will seek to exploit.', 'McAndrews said the case against Cosby was “a little weaker” than it was before Friday’s ruling, when the possibility existed that multiple accusers could be allowed to testify. But he said that the prosecution still had Constand, Prior Alleged Victim Six and Cosby’s own deposition to rely on. The judge had earlier ruled the Cosby deposition, in a civil case filed by Constand more than a decade ago, would be admissible.', 'Friday’s ruling was the latest development in a case that began 14 months ago, when the newly elected Steele — who had run on a prosecute-Cosby platform — filed charges against the comedian just before the statute of limitations on Constand’s case was set to expire. O’Neill has said he wants the trial to start no later than June.', 'Many victims-rights and women’s groups have rallied around the case as the best chance for Cosby to face justice. They also have said they wish for other victims to have their day in court.', 'Steele issued a statement suggesting the upside of the decision.', '“[It] is important,” he said, “as the jury will now be allowed to assess evidence that is relevant to establishing a common plan, scheme and design of sexual abuse.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

It featured Buddy Hield, a 23-year-old rookie who shoots well but is limited otherwise, and a first-round pick that is top-three protected in June.', 'The trade’s ripples went beyond that befuddlement, especially with a superstar going to a small market and Divac’s justification that a “better deal” was missed two days earlier.', 'The trade created the NBA’s top frontcourt duo with Cousins and Anthony Davis, made the Pelicans a playoff factor, set the Kings back further, drove down Brooklyn’s asking price for Brook Lopez, helped Philadelphia’s unprotected 2019 pick from Sacramento, and put New Orleans on watch after Cousins’ agent told ESPN that any team trading for Cousins would be “highly unlikely” to re-sign him in July.', 'Boston sits tight at the trade deadline and is praised.', 'New York stands pat at the trade deadline and is razed.', 'The Celtics and Knicks were two of last week’s most-rumored teams to be involved in a blockbuster deal.

Tucker for needed spacing and toughness\xa0third-place Washington acquiring Bojan Bogdanovic to bolster its bench\xa0and fifth-place Atlanta becoming Ersan Ilyasova’s fifth team since June.', 'Second-place Boston was loud in the Paul George and Jimmy Butler rumor mill but quiet on the transaction wire. First-place Cleveland — having made its big move in January to land Kyle Korver — \xa0might not be as vulnerable as perceived while Kevin Love mends, but Toronto closed the gap best.', '“The Ibaka deal is the most interesting because he has proven to have playoff mettle,” Penn said. “He fits well with the rest of their talent. He’s capable of really affecting the game defensively, he’s adequate offensively and they’re a darned good team with good finishers. That makes Toronto quite a bit more formidable in the East.”', 'Houston was not content that it separated from the pack that is trailing Golden State and San Antonio. Unsatisfied with being the No. 2 offense, the Rockets added scoring.

Just by watching the Cousins deal, their unprotected 2019 pick from Sacramento looks better.', '“The beauty of their trades is declaring more who they are building around,” Penn said. “They are thrilled with where they sit.”', 'Denver helped the long-term promise of Nikola Jokic by trading Jusuf Nurkic, who made for an awful short-term look when coupled with Jokic. The long-term impact could get skewed by losing a first-round pick and acquiring a pending free agent, Mason Plumlee.', 'Chicago kept Butler and gave him a potential long-term starting point guard, Cameron Payne, in a five-player deal that helped Oklahoma City instantly with Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott.

Cartoon Network’s series “Justice League Action,” about a group of DC Comics superheroes that includes Superman and Batman, has episodes that last only 11 minutes, but the series has attracted an impressive number of stars to voice heroic and villainous roles.', 'Starting with the return to TV of longtime Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy, who last took on the Dark Knight in 2006’s “Justice League Unlimited”\xa0series, “Action”\xa0boasts a glittery cast that includes James Woods, Ken Jeong, Mark Hamill, Carl Reiner, Sean Astin, Christian Slater, Brent Spiner and Hannibal Buress.', 'The assemblage  speaks to the rise in popularity and respect in the superhero genre of film and television. Conroy was particularly impressed by the new additions, some of which may have only been around for one episode, and that was one big reason why he returned to the role.', '“Cloris Leachman is amazing. Carl Reiner was giving us all a lesson on how to edit yourself when he came on,”\xa0said Conroy. “They’ve brought a lot of new characters like Booster Gold, who Diedrich Bader plays, and he’s phenomenally funny.

With such a short time period, an actor can get in and get out, and the exposition and introductions that usually make up a show\xa0are done away with.', '“What’s interesting about the format is that it’s deceptive,” said Conroy. “The writing assumes you know the characters [and] assumes you know the world they’re living in."', 'Conroy, in the meantime, definitely knows the world his character lives in after 25 years of voicing him. Despite not being on a TV series, he’s created many straight-to-video animated films that allowed him to maintain a firm grip on Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne.', '“The character he evolves into as the Batman, to me that’s his comfort space,” said\xa0Conroy. “To me, Bruce Wayne is the character, the costume.”', 'He’s one constant in a changing franchise. “Justice League Action” airs on Saturdays at 7:30 a.m. on Cartoon Network.', 'See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour &gt&gt »', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

What should I say?”', 'Franco’s attorney, Dante Gomez, said it was unfair to characterize Grant as begging for her life.\xa0', '“In the first lines of the recording, the person who\'s being accused here is saying, let me take you to the hospital, let me call 911,” Gomez said. "My client and I\xa0are looking forward to a jury evaluating all the evidence, not just what\'s been presented in the prosecution\'s trial brief."', 'He added that his defense will likely include Franco’s longstanding mental health issues.\xa0In 2011 Franco tried to commit suicide and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, Gomez said.', '“I\xa0do intend on calling mental health professionals who did examine Mr. Franco two years before the alleged crime," Gomez said. \xa0\xa0', 'A spokesman from the\xa0Riverside County district attorney’s office declined to comment on the case.', 'Jury selection has begun,\xa0and testimony is\xa0expected to begin in March.\xa0', 'The message recording is just one of a number of pieces of evidence prosecutors plan to present at trial, including an alleged jailhouse confession and surveillance video.

He’s running on a “Union Power” slate.', '\xa0', 'Opposing him is Lisa Karahalios, 52, a longtime active union member who served as the UTLA representative on the district committee, chaired by board member Monica Ratliff, that unearthed problems with the district’s now-canceled iPads-for-all effort.\xa0Karahalios is part of an all-woman “Sisterhood Slate” for the union’s various citywide union offices. They assert\xa0that help for members with problems at schools is being neglected in favor of an obsession with\xa0big-picture politics.\xa0', 'Other candidates are running as independents.', 'Union members will already have made their choices\xa0by March 7, which is Election Day for the city of Los Angeles and the Board of Education. How people vote on the board seats will give a sense of\xa0whether the union’s political revival has gained hold externally.', 'Both candidates\xa0for the union post\xa0agree that charter schools are a crucial issue in the city election.\xa0A\xa0vast majority of these privately managed public schools\xa0are non-union.', 'L.A. Unified already has the most charters and students attending charters of any school system in the nation. Charter students now make up\xa016% of enrollment. Charter schools’\xa0philanthropic backers\xa0want to see more growth, which would mean fewer members for United Teachers Los Angeles and less money for L.A. Unified, the union teachers’ employer.', 'The union had 45,000 members\xa0in 2008, when there were more school-age children\xa0in L.A. and fewer charters. It now has 32,000 members — teachers, counselors and nurses.', 'In the school board races,\xa0UTLA-backed candidates are facing off against those supported by charter-school advocates. Although the union can’t match charter backers dollar for dollar, it’s ultimately likely to spend\xa0well over\xa0$1 million to plug its candidates and to try to convince voters that\xa0charter-backed candidates are the tools of billionaire donors who would work on behalf of a Trump agenda —\xa0because Trump\xa0views increasing the number\xa0of charters as key to giving families more choices in schooling options.', 'Charter advocates\xa0point out\xa0that former President Obama also\xa0supported\xa0the growth of\xa0charter schools.', '“Clearly, UTLA has bet heavily on its ability to demonize and resist charters,” said Charles Kerchner, senior research fellow with the\xa0School of Educational Studies at\xa0Claremont Graduate University, who has not taken sides. “I don’t know what their Plan B is.”', 'Paying for Plan A was accomplished in part by persuading members last year to\xa0raise their dues by about 50%, to around $1,000 a year.', 'Caputo-Pearl has added eight senior\xa0union positions, with a ninth paid for by a national parent union. In line with his organizing and political goals, these jobs\xa0include\xa0a campaign research director, a political director, four organizers and two\xa0staff members\xa0to represent teachers at charter schools.', 'For years, Caputo-Pearl\xa0said, “UTLA was operating in a way that lacked sufficient strategy, coherence, and direction. … We have addressed this, and UTLA is operating with unprecedented strength.”', 'His approach has been praised by union leaders such as Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who, according to union rules,\xa0is taking no position on which candidate should win.', 'Karahalios, a middle school teacher, said the union is not so helpful to\xa0individual teachers in need.', '“While UTLA needs to be engaged at the state and national level, we need to prioritize our local issues,” she said.\xa0', 'She and other critics also question\xa0the\xa0staff expansion and accuse\xa0Caputo-Pearl of stifling dissent. The\xa0union’s election committee, they note,\xa0declined to hold traditional candidate forums this year.', 'Caputo-Pearl said that decision was made\xa0independently of him, but former union President A.J. Duffy called\xa0it odd and improper. That said, Duffy praised Caputo-Pearl’s overall record and predicted his reelection.', '“He got his members a 10% raise and maintained health benefits — no other issue will supersede that,” Duffy said.', 'To read the article in Spanish, click here', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

By excluding a number of the country’s largest news\xa0outlets from the day’s official White House\xa0briefing in favor of friendlier media, Trump administration\xa0spokesman\xa0Sean Spicer ratcheted\xa0up the White House’s war on the free press Friday to a new level. We obviously have a personal stake in this issue —\xa0The Times was one of the outlets blackballed, along with CNN, Politico,\xa0the New York Times and the BBC —\xa0but the episode ought to disturb anyone who believes presidents\xa0should be thick-skinned enough to be held accountable by skeptical journalists.', 'On the one hand, the excluded reporters might feel relieved at having a day off from Spicer’s usual stream of\xa0counterfactual spin. This is, after all, the press secretary who began his tenure on a Chico Marx note, telling reporters not to believe what they saw at the inauguration with their own eyes and instead accept the administration’s grossly exaggerated attendance estimates.\xa0', 'The session Friday was less\xa0formal one —\xa0a “gaggle” in Washington-speak — and it was attended by broadcast and print “pool” reporters whose job was to take notes on behalf of everyone not in the room. And the White House argues that by opening the room to a few extra reporters, it was expanding access, not narrowing it.', 'That’s the kind of argument Chico Marx would make too.', 'Ninety minutes before Spicer was scheduled to speak to reporters in the White House briefing room, his office alerted reporters that he\xa0would be holding an off-camera session with an “expanded pool.” It then conspicuously excluded reporters from selected news media\xa0while allowing in three pool reporters\xa0and a hand-picked group of eight others, four of them from right-of-center\xa0outlets\xa0that have been, shall we say, uncritical of the president (such as Breitbart and the One America News Network). Not to put too fine a point on it, but only one of the five major TV news networks that cover the White House was excluded: CNN, a frequent punching bag of President Trump.', 'This all happened shortly after Trump took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference for a stump speech that began with a salvo against the news media and its use of anonymous sources to bash the White House. (Sample quote: “We are fighting fake news.”)', 'So what message was the administration\xa0sending when Spicer\xa0put a velvet rope up outside his office? What could possibly be the rationale\xa0for excluding selected White House reporters from an on-the-record session with the White House spokesman in the White House?', 'If the intent was\xa0to intimidate reporters into writing fewer things that the administration does not like, and more things that it does, it is doomed to failure. Bear in mind that the Trump campaign barred\xa0several news organizations from attending its events, and that didn’t seem to make a scintilla of difference to their coverage.', 'Nor can the administration\xa0expect to have any more success in controlling the coverage it receives. After all, the easiest and least important part of the job is getting what Spicer was denying to some on Friday: the spin doled\xa0out at sessions like the daily briefing. The harder and more vital task is to ferret out what’s really going on behind the scenes that is not disclosed in the\xa0press releases and photo opportunities.', 'And it’s that kind of reporting that has really gotten under Trump’s skin. He has railed against stories leaked to journalists by people within the new administration —\xa0anonymous sources that Trump wants the public to believe do not actually exist. Granted, these sources may not get everything right they’re often\xa0pushing their own version of events. But the ones in the Trump administration\xa0are hardly fake —\xa0they’re just the latest in a long line of government leakers, whistle-blowers and others whose personal agendas don’t line up with their employer’s.\xa0', 'Trump has betrayed\xa0some alarmingly authoritarian notions of the presidency over the past two years, and punishing organizations that run stories critical of the president falls right into that category. It also evokes memories of that most famous White House compiler of an enemies list, Richard Nixon —\xa0probably not the president whose footsteps Trump wants to follow.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

The modern pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five events -- swimming, fencing, cross-country running, shooting and show jumping.', 'To a kid growing up in New Mexico, it seemed like something out of a dream or maybe an action movie.', 'Nathan Schrimsher had shown potential while competing for a local swim club, prompting a coach to pull him aside and suggest he try modern pentathlon.', '“Riding horses? Shooting guns? Sword-fighting?” Schrimsher recalls thinking. “Why are all these weird sports put together?”', 'A decade later, the 24-year-old ranks among the world’s best in a quirky Olympic sport that demands incongruous skills — running, swimming, equestrian, fencing and pistol shooting — all performed in a single, whirlwind day.', 'To make things even trickier, athletes are assigned unfamiliar horses in the equestrian segment and must scramble through dozens of rapid-fire, one-touch bouts in fencing.', 'Running and shooting are combined, forcing them to take aim at distant targets while breathing hard and wiping sweat from their eyes.', '“It isn’t like the decathlon where you have 10 different kinds of track and field,” said David Wallechinsky, an Olympic historian. “This takes a special kind of athlete.”', 'Name another event that has seen a runner sprint toward victory, only to stumble over a potted plant. Or a medal favorite try to punch his horse. Or a young lieutenant named George S. Patton Jr. throw a fit as he finishes just off the podium', 'This week, top men and women pentathletes from around the world have gathered in Southern California to compete in this sport that has a history of unpredictability.', '“It’s like a box of chocolates,” Schrimsher said. “You never know what you’re going to get.”', '::', 'Modern pentathlon does not draw big crowds or take place in fancy arenas. This week, the World Cup circuit has landed at a county fairgrounds in Pomona.', 'Because the Fairplex does not have a pool, men’s qualifying began Wednesday with the field taking a bus to a nearby health club.', 'Racquetball players and yoga students turned to look as a herd of elite athletes trudged through. Schrimsher and his colleagues are accustomed to puzzled glances.', '“No one really knows what we do,” he said.', 'Growing up in Roswell, Schrimsher was similarly bewildered when he and his younger brother, Lucas, were enlisted by their swim coach. The boys, who had experience riding and shooting on their family’s cattle ranch, soon threw themselves into the sport.', 'The original pentathlon, in ancient Greece, featured a very different blend of running, spear-throwing, discus and long jump, culminating in a fierce wrestling match that ended only when one of the combatants surrendered.', 'As Baron Pierre de Coubertin launched the modern Games in the late 1800s, he suspected these warrior skills favored by Sparta might be too dangerous. Still, the idea of a diverse event was appealing.', '“Athletes were too specialized for him,” said Rob Stull, an Olympic pentathlete who now heads the sport’s governing body in the U.S. “He was trying to make better people.”', 'On several occasions, De Coubertin proposed a new form of pentathlon but was rejected by his fellow Olympic leaders. He needed a story to persuade them.', 'So he made one up about a cavalry officer ordered to deliver a message during wartime. The soldier sets off on a horse picked from the stable, but is forced to dismount and fight the enemy with pistol and sword. Escaping, he swims across a river, then runs to his destination.', 'Modern pentathlon finally debuted in 1912.', 'De Coubertin believed it would test “a man’s moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills, producing thereby a complete athlete.”', '::', 'The pool at the Claremont Club was a little warm for Schrimsher’s liking, but the starting blocks felt good. Swimming is one of his strengths — it helped him finish 11th at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics — and he churned to a fast time Wednesday in the 200 meters.', 'Back at the Fairplex, there were only a few minutes to dress in heavy fencer’s gear at an exposition hall that echoed with clanging steel blades.', 'Epee is normally a cautious undertaking, with opponents jockeying back and forth, but in pentathlon the bouts are limited to one minute in qualifying and 45 seconds in the final round. If neither opponent scores a touch, both register a loss.', 'Schrimsher proceeded through a marathon of brief clashes, one after another, constantly pushing forward on the strip while trying not to be reckless. He bounced and flicked his blade, looking for opportunities to lunge.', '“It’s so fast,” he said. “Anything can happen.”', 'At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the reigning silver medalist — Borys Onyshchenko of the former Soviet Union — was caught using an epee that allowed him to record touches by pressing a concealed button.', 'There have been other curious moments in the sport’s history.', 'A 26-year-old Patton prepared for the 1912 Games on a diet of raw steak and salad, according to Wallechinsky’s “The Complete Book of the Olympics.”', 'The future general complained bitterly during the shooting event, claiming he was charged with a miss when one of his bullets passed cleanly through a hole that was already in the target. Before the cross-country run, Wallechinsky wrote, Patton received an injection of opium — a legal performance-enhancer at the time — but ultimately finished fifth.', 'At the 1932 Los Angeles Games, eventual champion Johan Oxenstierna of Sweden was nearly arrested while taking practice shots in the woods near the gun range.', 'The 1968 Mexico City Olympics saw Hans-Jurgen Todt of West Germany lose any chance at a medal when the horse he drew repeatedly balked at an obstacle on the show-jumping course. An infuriated Todt\xa0 attacked the animal and had to be restrained by teammates.', 'Though the riding competition involves some luck, Stull said the best pentathletes can use their experience — and a 20-minute warmup — to adapt to any animal.', '“With German horses, the big warmbloods, you have to sit deep in the saddle or they won’t jump,” he said. “If you do that on an Italian horse, they’ll just take off.”', 'Even the running segment is vulnerable to idiosyncrasies.', 'At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, athletes had to race across spongy ground. Svante Rasmuson of Sweden took the lead with 100 meters remaining but stumbled and kicked one of the potted plants that marked the course’s boundary.', 'After finishing second to an Italian runner, Rasmuson grumbled: “I hate soft dirt.”', '::', 'The fencing did not go so well for Schrimsher, who won only about half of his bouts. Peeling away his sweaty uniform as he stepped into a changing area, he grumbled: “I’m glad that’s over.”', 'With 63 men in Wednesday’s preliminary round — and 53 in the women’s event — it was impossible to supply enough horses, so the riding portion was reserved only for the finals. Competitors moved directly to the last preliminary event, the laser-run.', '“If I can shoot well, then I’ll just hold on for the run,” Schrimsher said. “Running is my weak link.”', 'In an era when the Olympics have tried to stay relevant by adding snowboarding and BMX racing, modern pentathlon has lived in fear of being dropped from the program.', 'Baseball, softball and wrestling officials complained when their sports were cut — the latter was subsequently reinstated — and De Coubertin’s favorite was not. Pentathlon has tried to make itself more viewer-friendly with each successive Olympics.', 'In 1996, the competition was compressed from five days to one. A women’s division was added four years later. In 2012, shooting switched to laser pistols and combined with the run.', 'Still, the grandstand at the Fairplex horse racing track was mostly empty for Wednesday’s laser-run.\xa0', 'Competitors lined up at a long table, aiming their pistols 10 meters down-range at a target the size of an orange. As one of the best marksmen on the World Cup circuit, Schrimsher quickly plinked the required five hits and took off running, following a sandy path that wound 800 meters through the race track’s infield.', '“You have to look around,” he said. “Where am I at? Who do I have to catch?”', 'With a chill wind blowing and dark clouds bunched against the nearby San Gabriel Mountains, the runners could stay cool but soon battled fatigue as they repeated the shoot-and-run loop four times. Weary arms made aiming difficult. Several athletes — struggling to hit the target five times — threw their hands up in frustration.', '“We’ve all been put through the wringer on this,” Schrimsher said.', 'Training for such diverse challenges can be costly, so pentathletes have traditionally come from the military. Schrimsher is a sergeant in the U.S. Army’s elite athlete program, which allows him to hone his skills while serving active duty.', 'Calmly squeezing off shots — and trying not to lose too much time in the running — he crossed the finish line with a spot in the finals, which were scheduled to conclude Friday evening.', 'With the women’s finals and mixed team relays continuing through the weekend, Schrimsher wasn’t exactly banking on huge crowds, but — given modern pentathlon’s unusual nature and even stranger history — he wished more people would give it a chance.', '“It is a weird sport when you talk about it,” he said. “When you see it, it’s really cool.”', "The Times' Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry discuss the progress the Rams made during offseason organized team activities and minicamp.", "The Times' Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry discuss the progress the Rams made during offseason organized team activities and minicamp.", "The Times' Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry discuss the progress the Rams made during offseason organized team activities and minicamp.", "The Times' Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry discuss the progress the Rams made during offseason organized team activities and minicamp.", "It's the final week of practice for the Chargers in San Diego, before moving the organization to Los Angeles.

McKenzie, Jonathan Majors and Emily Skeggs, respectively —  become organizers who pool their leadership skills and followings to rally in unison for lesbian and gay causes.', 'Cultural touchstones such as turkey-baster babies and bath houses are referenced here, as well as legislation like Proposition 6, meant to ban gays and lesbians from working in California public schools. The characters  successfully lobby against the bill, and for the election of Milk for city supervisor. When he’s murdered in office, they find even more cause to rally for fair treatment in the eyes of the law.', 'By the 1980s, the Castro neighborhood is a safe haven for the LGBT community, hate crimes are down and the police are protecting instead of harassing the community. But the AIDS epidemic hits, and being young and gay once again proves a deadly combination.', 'Cleve and Ken, who both find they’re HIV positive, watch their longtime partners succumb to the disease. The government ignores the growing epidemic, partly because it’s considered a gay disease. Cleve creates an AIDS quilt to memorialize those who’ve died and to draw national attention to the crisis. It’s also the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” era, and as a gay man, Ken has trouble accessing the healthcare he needs. Roma uses the clout she’s gained lobbying for previous causes to push for low-cost and free healthcare. As all three civil rights veterans move into the 2000s, the once unthinkable victory of same-sex marriage becomes a reality. ', 'Though the star power doesn’t arrive until the last two episodes, it’s the first half of “When We Rise” that is riveting. The early years are passionate and filled with urgency, mirroring the excitement and promise of an era still basking in the glow of the optimistic ’60s. The grind of adulthood, and its responsibilities, is sometimes all too real in the second half.', 'The abrupt transition from the younger cast to the older actors is also jarring because they look and act like different people, so it’s up to the viewer to forget the past and make that leap. Still, the love scenes throughout —  not just sex, but intimacy as well —  artfully push the boundaries of what network TV is usually willing to show between same-sex couples.', '“When We Rise” is the most impactful LGBT-centric series since HBO’s “Angels in America” more than a decade ago.

Styled as a prequel to Luc Besson’s vigilante action trilogy of the same name, "Taken," which premieres in series form Monday on NBC, does share with the films a lead character named Bryan Mills, originally played by Liam Neeson, and instances in which a character is “taken.” Mainly, it shares the title — there was gold in that franchise.', '(The series is set in the present, so if, as press materials have it, "in 30 years, this character is destined to become the Bryan Mills that we’ve come to love" from the movies — a retired CIA agent and the proverbial guy you don’t want to mess with — \xa0someone is going to have to send him down a wormhole.)', 'At this point in his life, Mills (Clive Standen, "Vikings") is an ex-super-soldier newly recruited by Christina Hart (Jennifer Beals) into a hyper-secret, incredibly tiny “emergency covert action team.” She finds him useful to her immediate ends for him, it’s, as they say in the pictures, "personal” — a matter of “Come for the revenge, stay for the national welfare.”', 'Although they’re tossed the odd “humanizing” throwaway line about a coffee maker or a falafel place in Fallouja, Mills\' new co-workers at the spy shop — icy at first, soon to warm — \xa0are distinguishable one from another mainly by physical appearance. In the fashion of "24," they are either running around out in the field or back at headquarters guiding other characters as they run around in the field, via the satellites and closed-circuit cameras that make such scenes possible.', 'Some are played by actors you may recognize, including Jose Pablo Cantillo from "The Walking Dead" and Gaius Charles from "Grey\'s Anatomy.” Jennifer Marsala stood out for me just by virtue of seeming to have a softer side in a show where grim determination is the dominant note. Standen is boyish and brawny. The actors aren’t the problem.', 'Is there a problem? Developed by Alexander Carey ("Homeland," "In Plain Sight"), “Taken" is a meat and potatoes melodrama — \xa0garnished with a little bit of sentiment, seasoned with the odd teardrop, but fundamentally a thing of steak and starch. It may be overcooked and unexceptional, like a midlevel chain restaurant meal, but those places are full of customers and many will doubtless find it satisfying.', 'This may be because the show confirms them in their fearfulness, or fearfulness as an attitude they don’t mind adopting for entertainment purposes. The writing takes a rather benign attitude toward the use of black site imprisonment and a discomfitingly gleeful approach to torture. (Mills’ potential love interest, an “environmental lawyer” played by Brooklyn Sudano, may be a source of pushback.) There is a high body count human targets are dispassionately dispatched, by bad and good guys alike.', "But the show's approach to terrorism is at least ecumenical — \xa0it wants you to know that it knows that not all villains come from foreign lands, and that the greed of a giant corporation is no less evil than that of a gun-running narco-terrorist or a duly elected nutjob with apocalyptic tendencies. As is often the case in such stories, freedom is balanced on the back of the intelligence community. Maybe that’s how it really is — I’m not at liberty to say.", '‘Taken’', 'Where: NBC', 'When: 10 p.m. Monday', 'Rating: TV-14-LV (may be unsuitable for children under the age of 14 with advisories for coarse language and violence)', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

Miguel Aguilar never wanted to leave Mexico.', '“All I could think of was all my friends are here, all my cousins are here. I want to stay here,” he said of the day his mother bundled him\xa0and his brother Andres into a pickup pointed toward the U.S. border.', 'It was Aguilar’s 11th\xa0birthday.', 'Twelve years later he doesn’t want to go back. And that leaves Aguilar, a midfield hopeful with the Galaxy, trapped in uncertainty between his homeland and his home.', 'Aguilar is among the more than 861,000 undocumented immigrants who received protection from deportation under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The executive order provides work permits for people brought to the U.S. as children, provided they meet certain conditions.', 'What it doesn’t provide is a path to lawful, permanent status in the U.S. And with President Trump aggressively expanding immigration enforcement policies, Aguilar is now apprehensive about his future.', '“He’s targeting people like myself,” Aguilar said. “I think that’s grounds to be concerned.”', 'A first-round pick of D.C. United in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft, Aguilar is believed to be the first DACA recipient to become a professional athlete. And though that temporary status allowed him to work, get a driver’s license and graduate from the University of San Francisco with a finance degree and a 3.7 grade-point average, if the new administration rescinds DACA, Aguilar could find himself the first MLS player to be deported.', 'That’s a fear that has become prevalent in the DACA community, said Harvard professor Roberto Gonzales, who has done extensive study on the program.', '“To be sure, it’s very palpable right now. They’re justified in being anxious,” said Gonzales, who surveyed 2,700 DACA beneficiaries in 2013 and found that nearly 85% of them worried that someone close to them would be deported.', '“It’s a population largely of American-raised, American-educated young people,” Gonzales continued. “A generation or more of young people who have gone through many of the same experiences as their American-born friends and peers.”', 'That certainly describes Aguilar’s upbringing.', 'His parents separated when he was 9 and his mother Carmen fought to protect two sons and a daughter in the border town of Ciudad Juarez, where running gun battles between rival drug cartels had turned the city into one of most dangerous places on the planet.', 'So she secured travel visas for her children and sold the family’s belongings —\xa0\xa0including Miguel’s Disney videos and Hot Wheels cars — at a yard sale to finance their journey to Sacramento, where relatives took them in.', '“We were just kind of leaving everything behind,” Aguilar remembered. “We weren’t thinking of coming back.”', 'So when those visas expired, the Aguilars exchanged life on the firing line in Mexico for life in the shadows in the U.S.', 'Aguilar understood only a few words of English when he entered middle school in Sacramento, and with the family bouncing from apartment to apartment, he struggled in the classroom. But he thrived on the soccer field — which is where he met Tibor Pelle, a former UCLA player and coach who convinced him to apply himself in school as well.', 'Once in danger of dropping out, Aguilar became a model student at Encina Preparatory High. He then moved on to USF, graduating with honors a semester ahead of schedule.', 'USF is also where he met Erin Ah Choy, a follow student from Hawaii, whom he married last spring. She remains in Washington, where she works as an aide to Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), the first Japanese-born woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate.', 'After marrying, Aguilar, 23, applied for a green card, which he sees as the first step toward citizenship and a family. \xa0But that\xa0too\xa0appears to have become subject to politics. Although Aguilar said his application was approved long ago, he hasn’t received the green card yet and he worries the Trump administration may be changing the rules there as well.', '“It’s a tricky situation,” he said.', 'So is his place with the Galaxy. Aguilar appeared in 25 MLS games over two seasons with D.C. United, who traded his rights to the Galaxy in December in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2019 SuperDraft.', 'But the Galaxy’s once-barren midfield has since been restocked with the January acquisitions of Romain Alessandrini, Joao Pedro and Jermaine Jones, leaving it unlikely Aguilar will make the first-team roster which will be finalized this week. And though that would leave him free to sign with any MLS team, Aguilar said he’d prefer to stay here and play for the Galaxy’s USL affiliate, Galaxy II.', '“If there’s an opportunity there and there’s upward mobility — which there is a lot of the guys that played for the II are now playing on the first team — I’d consider that a good opportunity,” he said.', 'For starters, a place with Galaxy II would bring a degree of permanence to Aguilar’s life, allowing him to rent an apartment and bring his wife home from Washington. It might also help bring clarity to his uncertain immigration status, worries of which he can escape only on the soccer field.', '“The field, for me, is a bit of a sanctuary,” he said. “Definitely at times watching the news and reading different stories and articles, it is something that gets me thinking.', '“I get angry sometimes. There’s no empathy there, especially for kids.”', 'Of the four Aguilars who came across the border together in 2004, Miguel was the only one young enough to qualify for protection, even temporarily, from deportation. As a result he won’t speak publicly about the others, saying only that they remain in this country without legal status.', 'But it’s clear the difficulties his single mother endured, first rescuing her children from blood-soaked Juarez, then trying to provide for them in a new country where she wasn’t welcome, has colored Aguilar’s world view.', '“You’re telling me just because she was born on the wrong side of this border, that doesn’t make her a human anymore? That pisses me off,” \xa0said Aguilar, who hasn’t been able to see his father since he left Mexico. “The fact that a piece of paper is more important than humility and helping each other? I can go on and on about it.', '“Just that fear of separation of families again. That’s my biggest issue with this whole immigration stuff.”', 'To read the article in Spanish, click here', 'kevin.baxter@latimes.com ', 'Follow Kevin Baxter on Twitter\xa0@kbaxter11

The Democratic Party put its faith in its old guard Saturday to guide it out of the political wilderness, choosing as its new leader an Obama-era Cabinet secretary over the charismatic congressman backed by the progressive wing of the party.', 'Tom Perez, a former secretary of Labor with strong ties to unions, persuaded the spirited assembly of party delegates in Atlanta that he can best help harness a grass-roots outpouring of anti-Trump protest and anger into a Democratic resurgence at the ballot box.', '“We are suffering from a crisis of confidence, a crisis of relevance,” Perez told delegates before they chose him in a down-to-the-wire contest with Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, whom the Bernie Sanders wing of the party had rallied around.', '“We need a chair who can not only take the fight to Donald Trump.… We also need a chair who can lead a turnaround and change the culture of the Democratic Party,” Perez said.', 'President Trump tweeted his congratulations to Perez, adding “I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!”', 'The ascendance of an establishment liberal is certain to renew tension between Democratic Party stalwarts and the unruly progressive movement aligned with Sen. Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who both backed Ellison.', 'Some Ellison supporters erupted in protest as the final vote was announced.', 'Perez quickly sought to unite the party by naming Ellison his deputy chairman, a move unanimously approved by the 435 assembled delegates.', 'They had earlier supported Perez 235-200 in a second round of voting after several other candidates dropped out. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had appeared a potential challenger but dropped out before the first round of voting.', 'Ellison urged supporters not to “waste even a moment going at it about who supported who.… We don’t have the luxury of going out of this room divided.”', 'Perez, who takes over from Donna Brazile and is the first Latino to lead the Democratic National Committee, will become the new face of the beleaguered party on cable news networks and at campaign rallies after a year that saw not only heavy losses at the ballot box but Russian government hacking aimed at DNC computers.', 'But tending the talk show circuit will be overshadowed by a much tougher and less glamorous job: repairing a party tattered by bickering factions, muddled messaging and neglect after eight years of the Obama administration.', 'Following the stunning GOP wave in the 2016 election, the Democratic Party is weaker than it has been in decades.', 'Republicans now hold not only the White House and both houses of Congress they control 69 of the country’s 99 state legislative chambers and 33 governorships — including 25 states where they control both the governor’s office and the state legislature.', 'Perez was the favored choice of the Obama White House and the party establishment. He is a steady hand whose reorganization plans are ambitious but are not threatening to longtime party operatives. \xa0', 'Obama White House alums worked their connections in the states to garner delegate votes for him. Perez himself campaigned with a message similar to what Hillary Clinton used in her primary race against Sanders: He argued he was not just a progressive, but one who has gotten things done.', 'His victory was nonetheless a disappointment to the energetic movement Sanders inspired, which will be crucial to any successful effort at rebuilding the party and winning elections.', 'Progressive activists had seen the leadership race as an opportunity to take control of a party apparatus that has been hostile to their political vision. They had put their faith in Ellison to rebuild the party around the grass-roots organizing model Sanders harnessed during last year’s Democratic primaries.', 'Many were inspired by Ellison’s personal story as a minority politician whose majority-white, working-class district in Minneapolis elected him as the first Muslim member of Congress in 2007.', 'Sanders congratulated Perez in a statement that also warned, “It is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before.”', 'The uneasiness of progressives was underscored by a floor fight that played out just before the chairperson vote, in which delegates voted against reinstating a ban on corporate donations to the party.', 'The advocacy group Move On also put Perez on notice that it expects him to change a party that “has become too Washington-insider, too beholden to the same big donors and consultants, and too timid on issues of social, racial, and economic justice."', 'The leadership election did little to quiet the raging internal debate about what happened in November. There is no consensus about how Donald Trump smashed the so-called Blue Wall of Democratic strongholds and won state after state that the Democrats assumed were out of his reach.', 'Many progressives attribute the loss — and the erosion of power on the state level — to a weak message and failure to aggressively embrace a populist economic agenda, as well as a\xa0reluctance to embrace the identity politics that could energize minorities.\xa0', 'They say the white working-class Rust Belt\xa0voters who had backed Obama marked their ballots for Trump, or for third-party candidates, because they wanted big economic change, not more moderation.', 'Others in the party argue that’s a misreading of the election results, and that the path back to power for Democrats is not on the hard left.', 'Where Democrats fall in this debate guides how they approach upcoming elections. The party is grappling over how heavily to invest in recapturing voters it lost in the Midwest versus parts of the Southern states where minority populations are booming, and where Republicans are holding congressional seats in districts that Trump lost or just barely won.', 'But much of the work before Perez is even deeper in the weeds. He will have to rebuild the badly frayed network of state and county parties that form the backbone of the organization. Their disconnectedness to the Democratic National Committee and, in some cases, lack of persistent, steady management has become a major vulnerability.', 'He takes over the party at a difficult\xa0but also opportune time, amid the erupting anger over the direction Trump and the Republican-led Congress are taking the country.', 'Live updates from Washington »', 'Perez will need to move quickly to build the infrastructure needed to channel all that energy, and to keep it brewing through the next big election, which is still two years away.\xa0', 'Considering the party’s state of disarray, the leadership race was notable for its lack of public bloodletting.', 'The candidate forums were congenial, the campaign messaging polite — a reflection of the nature of this particular election, which is decided by party officials more preoccupied with nuts-and-bolts party business like resource allocation and how conventions will be run than with heady issues of ideology.', 'But simmering beneath the surface were tensions over how badly the party fared during the Obama years\xa0and who might be at fault.

Johnson, a NASA mathematician from the racially segregated West Computing group at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia. Johnson (portrayed by Taraji P.

The debacle may go down as one of the wildest moments ever on an Oscars telecast.', 'But the extraordinary scene — in which the wrong movie was announced for best picture at the end of the show — \xa0had no impact on anemic ratings for Hollywood’s biggest night.', 'The 89th Academy Awards was watched by an average of 32.9 million viewers Sunday, down about 4% from last year, when the telecast averaged 34.4 million viewers, according to preliminary national ratings from Nielsen. ', 'It was the smallest Oscars audience since 2008 and the third consecutive year that ratings have dropped. Among the explanations: the lateness of the show and the high number of nominations for smaller-budget films. The promise of strong criticism of President Trump from the Oscars participants may also have put off some viewers.', '“The dip in ratings can possibly be attributed to its very late running time, the box-office receipts for most of its little seen but highly acclaimed movies, and the fact that some might have thought it would be another politically laden awards show, which turned some people off in recent months,” said Billie Gold, vice president and director of programming research at the media buying firm Amplifi US. ', 'A crowded televised awards season (the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards precede the Oscars) and the tendency of younger viewers to spend more time watching video on their digital devices may have further depressed viewership. Nielsen data do not count those who watched the show via streaming.', 'Viewers and the audience inside the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood were stunned after learning the best picture statuette was mistakenly given to the producers of “La La Land” when presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway read from the wrong envelope. A chaotic scene ensued on stage as the award went to “Moonlight” before the telecast signed off.', 'The best picture award was presented — and re-presented — after Nielsen’s measurement of the Oscars telecast ended at 12:02 a.m. Eastern when ABC aired its last commercial break of the night. The program went off the air at 12:10 a.m. Eastern.', 'The late end time for the telecast also likely depressed the size of the audience. The Academy Awards end time was the latest since 2002, when it ended at 12:34 a.m. Eastern. Last year’s telecast ended at 11:51 p.m. Eastern.', 'There is some evidence of a political split in the audience based on the overnight ratings in individual markets.', 'The\xa0highest-rated markets for the telecast were New York, with a 31.1 rating, followed by San Diego (30.7), Los Angeles (30.5), Chicago (30.5), San Francisco (30.3), Philadelphia\xa0(25.3), Seattle (24.7), Boston (24.1), Denver (23.4) and Washington, D.C. (23.2). With the exception of Philadelphia, the markets were all in states that supported Trump’s 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.', 'The lowest-rated markets — Memphis (10.6), Dayton, Ohio (11.3),  Winston-Salem, N.C. (11.4) and New Orleans (12.6) —\xa0were all in states that went for Trump.', 'An overnight ratings point represents a percentage of homes in a market.', 'It’s uncertain whether the disarray at the end of the telecast did anything to hurt the Academy Awards’ brand going forward. ', 'Gold doesn’t see any long-term damage to the show’s appeal among audiences.', '“It reflects the power of live TV and true social moments that people love to remember and be part of,”\xa0 Gold said. “In fact, I am sure those who weren’t watching or who went to sleep late\xa0were sorry they missed what transpired. We’re in a society that wants to capture unexpected moments and be part of it, and last night’s telecast was one of those moments.”', 'It\xa0 helps when the Oscars ceremony celebrates a big box-office hit. The largest audience for the Academy Awards over the last 20 years was 55.2 million viewers in 1998 when “Titanic” — one of the biggest box-office hits of all-time — was honored for best picture. ', 'While the Academy Awards has not reached those ratings heights in recent years, it still ranks as the most-watched entertainment program of the year, commanding ad rates of $2 million for a 30-second commercial.

The Sheriff’s Department publicly stated that the mailers\xa0“could mislead members of the public to believe they are subject to legal action.”', 'The Office of the County Counsel, which represents\xa0the department and the county,\xa0sent a “cease and desist” letter Friday to the campaign, arguing that the campaign mailers improperly used the name of the Sheriff’s Department in violation of state law.', 'It demanded that the Yes on S campaign stop using the mailers,\xa0send out correction notices to everyone who had gotten them saying that the Sheriff’s Department did not authorize the use of its name or the message, and post the letter from county attorneys on its campaign website.', 'In reaction, the Yes on S campaign said Monday that there was “no merit” to those\xa0demands because “the mailer does not state or imply that the Sheriff’s Department endorses or is affiliated with it.” It argued that the mailers were lawful, protected political speech.', 'In a letter, Yes on S campaign\xa0attorney Fredric Woocher\xa0argued that the cease-and-desist letter could be seen as an effort to silence the ballot measure proponents.\xa0Backers of the campaign demand that county lawyers “publicly withdraw” their\xa0cease-and-desist demand and “refrain from further engaging in partisan politics,” Woocher wrote.', 'County spokesman Joel Sappell said Monday that the county believed its efforts had protected the public from getting “deceptive mailers” in the future and was still analyzing what steps it would take, if any, to ensure compliance.', 'In the letter sent to the Yes on S campaign last week, Office of the County Counsel attorney Lawrence Hafetz warned that the office would “pursue any and all available legal remedies, including seeking injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees,” if its demands were not met.', 'Ballot measure opponents sent a complaint last week to Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey and City Atty. Mike Feuer, arguing that the “offensive and illegal” mailers violated state laws against intimidating voters and impersonating a peace officer.\xa0Josh Kamensky, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, said Monday that the mailers were meant to “terrorize voters into supporting an initiative that will accelerate the pace of evictions.”\xa0', '“It escalates their disinformation campaign from confusion to fear," Kamensky said.', 'The ballot measure, which goes before voters next week, would impose a moratorium on building projects that seek zoning changes and other alterations in city rules. It would also prohibit amendments to the General Plan —\xa0a document that governs development across the city —\xa0for individual projects.\xa0', 'Backers have argued that stopping “mega-developments” would prevent longtime residents from being displaced from rent-controlled apartments. A\xa0Los Angeles Times review of city records found that only a small fraction of such evictions in recent years was caused by the types of projects that would be barred under Measure S. From\xa02011 to 2015, fewer than 200 rent-controlled homes were removed from the market by developers who were seeking the changes in city rules targeted by the ballot measure.', 'Supporters nonetheless argue that such projects became anchors for gentrification that prompts more evictions.

Lawyers representing the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department sent a letter Friday demanding that the backers of Measure S\xa0stop sending out mailers that mimic eviction notices.', 'The campaign mailers, which landed in mailboxes this week,\xa0are emblazoned with the phrase\xa0“EVICTION NOTICE”\xa0under the words “County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.”\xa0Below, in much smaller print,\xa0the mailer mentions\xa0the Measure S campaign committee and its chief financial backer, the\xa0AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\xa0', 'The other side of the mailer\xa0urges Angelenos to vote for Measure S, which would impose new limits on real estate development, saying apartments have been destroyed because “rich developers have had their way with City Hall.”', 'In their “cease and desist” letter, county attorneys said the campaign mailers are misleading and improperly use\xa0the Sheriff’s Department’s name, violating state law. They demanded that the Measure S campaign send a notice to anyone who received the mailer\xa0telling them the Sheriff’s Department\xa0had not authorized the use of its\xa0name or the message.', 'Jill Stewart, campaign director for Yes on S, did not say whether her group intends\xa0to comply.', '“We appreciate the county of Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day,”\xa0she said in an email.', 'The Sheriff’s Department later sent its own email blast saying the\xa0mailers had been “fabricated to look like official LASD documents.”', '“This message is to assure residents that the political mailer ... is counterfeit and could mislead members of the public to believe they are subject to legal action by the Sheriff’s Department,” the department said.', 'For decades, residents of South L.A. felt as though the development boom reshaping\xa0parts of Los Angeles was passing them by.', 'As developers erected looming towers in places such as downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and the Westside, they\xa0largely avoided building on the vacant lots\xa0south of the 10...', 'For decades, residents of South L.A. felt as though the development boom reshaping\xa0parts of Los Angeles was passing them by.', 'As developers erected looming towers in places such as downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and the Westside, they\xa0largely avoided building on the vacant lots\xa0south of the 10...', 'The mailers have alarmed some tenant advocates.\xa0Larry Gross, who heads the tenant\xa0rights group Coalition for Economic Survival, said frightened renters have called his group\xa0thinking they were facing eviction.', '“It’s so irresponsible and outrageous for them to put out something like that,” said Gross, whose group opposes Measure S.', 'Elena Popp, executive director of the Eviction Defense Network, defended the mailer, calling it a “forceful” way to highlight the issue of displacement.\xa0Building luxury housing “causes mass evictions and raises rents in surrounding neighborhoods,” said Popp, who supports Measure S and appears on the mailer.', 'Stewart also said she thought there were “strings being pulled,” since both the sheriff and the group opposing Measure S\xa0have relied on the same political consulting firm. Mike Shimpock, a consultant with the campaign opposing Measure S,\xa0called the claim “absolutely ridiculous.”', 'Opponents sent their own\xa0mailers that included the words “Eviction Notice” but did not use the name of the Sheriff’s Department.

It would prohibit the city from amending the General Plan,\xa0a document that governs development citywide,\xa0for individual real estate projects.\xa0', 'Backers say\xa0those restrictions will stop out-of-scale development that pushes out\xa0longtime residents. Opponents counter that the measure\xa0will eliminate jobs and drive\xa0up rents.', 'While the two sides debated the contents of the mailer,\xa0Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin launched his own attack on Measure S,\xa0calling\xa0on the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to provide “full disclosure” on the\xa0lawsuits that it is supporting.', 'The Times reported\xa0Friday\xa0that Michael Weinstein, the nonprofit foundation’s top executive, has refused to say whether his group is paying for legal challenges against development projects in Westwood and South Los Angeles. Weinstein also would not say how many land-use lawsuits his group is financing.', '“Nonprofits owe those whom they serve, and those in the city whom they serve, a duty of being transparent,” Galperin said at a No on S campaign event. “And the fact that they’re not wanting to do so is very disturbing. And it’s also very disturbing that millions of dollars that could be spent on housing, and on services, are instead being squandered on this ballot measure.”', 'The foundation has\xa0spent more than $4.9\xa0million on the Measure S campaign so far.\xa0Weinstein said Friday that the money spent on the campaign is “a tiny percentage” of his group’s overall budget.', 'Weinstein has long argued that\xa0displacement\xa0of low-income renters is\xa0an issue that affects people with HIV. Asked about Galperin’s demand for transparency, Weinstein said that legal spending by his group is not public information.', '“My question is, how come [Galperin] hasn’t spoken to me?” he said. “Obviously, he’s just doing it to make a public splash. He hasn’t requested [the information] of me or of AHF. He’s doing it as part of a campaign rally.”', 'Measure S backers took their fight to City Hall, testifying during a council meeting about the companies and real estate executives who have been fighting the measure. Among the biggest opponents is developer Crescent Heights, which put at least $1.4 million into the opposition campaign.\xa0The foundation is\xa0suing to stop Crescent Heights from building two 30-story towers next to its 21st-floor headquarters.', 'Supporters of Measure S said $150,000 came from a company affiliated with Frank McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, while $95,000 came from Century City  Realty.\xa0Stewart, the campaign director,\xa0drew a contrast between such\xa0donors and the foundation, which has treated hundreds of thousands of patients.', '“Our billion-dollar nonprofit representing us is the good guy,”\xa0she told the council. “Your billionaire developers and organizations are the bad guys.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Alex Caputo-Pearl has won a second three-year term as president of United Teachers Los Angeles, the union that represents teachers, counselors and nurses in L.A. Unified.', 'The results announced Monday were a strong vote of confidence for the union leader, who received 82% of the vote against challenger Lisa Karahalios. His “Union Power” slate also won, sweeping all seven citywide offices, even though the opponents included veteran and respected union leaders. All the winners received more than 50% of ballots cast, allowing them to avoid a runoff.', 'A union release called the victory a mandate to keep pressing on several fronts —\xa0among them, higher salaries,\xa0continued strong health and retiree benefits and\xa0class-size reduction\xa0to benefit\xa0students\xa0and teachers.', 'Some district officials have questioned whether the nation’s second-largest school system can afford another \xa0raise for teachers on the heels of the current contract’s\xa010% increase over two\xa0years. This\xa0most recent raise followed several years of job cutbacks and eight years with no raises other than those built in for experience and education\xa0level.', 'The union’s platform also includes an ongoing effort to rein in charter schools,\xa0which have proved popular with many families, but mostly are nonunion.', 'The union statement also\xa0articulated a more recent priority: “defending our students and communities from federal anti-immigrant and anti-human rights attacks.”', '“It’s an affirmation of the direction we’ve been headed,” Caputo-Pearl, 48, said in an interview after the tabulation.\xa0“It gives us a lot of wind in our sails in the upcoming fights for a good contract, for state legislation\xa0that holds charter schools accountable and also in the school board races and in our efforts to take on Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos."', 'President\xa0Trump’s education agenda is not entirely clear. In the past, DeVos, his billionaire Education secretary,\xa0has bankrolled efforts to promote charter schools as well as tax breaks and government-funded subsidies for students to attend private schools.', 'Karahalios had argued that Caputo-Pearl’s team was neglecting the needs of individual teachers as it pursued a broad political agenda. She also questioned the effectiveness\xa0of his push to limit charter school growth. But her campaign failed to gain traction\xa0because\xa0many members closed ranks around Caputo-Pearl during what they perceive as perilous times for teachers and traditional public education.', 'Caputo-Pearl will have little time to savor his victory because the union is locked in another election struggle, over three of seven board seats on the L.A. Board of Education. The union and affiliated unions are\xa0expected to spend well over $1\xa0million to retain a\xa0board that is generally pro-union. Supporters of charter schools are expected to pay even more to try to tip the balance.\xa0', '“We are going 100 miles per hour,” Caputo-Pearl said.', 'Katie Braude, leader of the parents group Speak UP, which has sided with the pro-charter candidates, offered measured congratulations. She said Monday that she shared the union president’s goal\xa0of treating teachers well, but added:\xa0“I challenge him to always put the interests of kids first, even when it clashes with the interests of his own members."', 'An official with the state charter school association was more blunt.\xa0', "“Instead of three more years of baseless attacks on charter public schools and families, we are hopeful he will value a parent’s right to select a school best suited for their child's learning needs,” said Richard Garcia, director of elections communications for California Charter Schools Assn. Advocates.\xa0\xa0 \xa0", 'The union sent out 31,036 ballots and 26.4% of members voted.

With the spillway closed, the reservoir will continue to fill. If it gets too close to a level officials deem unsafe, they will have to begin releasing water again.', 'The National Weather Service said rain isn’t expected until the weekend, and it’s too early to say how much could fall. Melting snow may carry lots of water into the reservoir this spring or summer, but it should not be anywhere near the pace that recently pushed the reservoir to capacity, said DWR chief hydrologist Maury Roos.', '“At the moment, things look pretty safe,” he said.', 'The main\xa0concrete spillway was damaged earlier this month after\xa0a week of powerful storms and after\xa0an earthen\xa0emergency spillway that was used when the reservoir reached capacity also rapidly eroded.', 'Officials need to keep the dam water levels in check because of damage to the emergency spillway that\xa0carries water when the reservoir\xa0goes above capacity. Damage to that spillway earlier this month prompted the evacuation of 100,000 people. Officials were able to use the damaged main spillway to reduce water levels, easing the crisis.', 'Interviews and records suggest\xa0that the\xa0near-catastrophe grew out of\xa0fundamental problems with the original design of the emergency spillway that were never corrected despite questions about its adequacy.', 'The “solid” bedrock that officials thought would stand up to the force of the spill was soft and easily eroded. The long concrete lip of the spillway was not anchored into the rock. Critical power lines were strung across the spillway, which consists of nothing more than an earthen hillside covered with trees and brush.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Who dropped the ball? What did the “La La Land” producers know and when did they know it? Was there a second set of envelopes from the grassy knoll? (Kind of.) Is this Hollywood’s Zapruder film and, if so, who is Babushka Lady?', 'We watched and rewatched, fast-forwarded, rewound and froze frames.

So well, in fact, that PricewaterhouseCoopers managing partner Brian Cullinan tweeted a photo of Emma Stone with her newly\xa0received award for lead actress at 9:05 p.m. Pacific.\xa0', 'The tweet doesn’t necessarily mean that\xa0Cullinan was derelict in his duties, but it’s also since been deleted from his Twitter feed.', 'Cullinan’s tweet wouldn’t even be noteworthy but for the fact that he was one of two people in the entire world responsible for the envelopes containing the Oscar winners at that moment. And things were about to go very wrong.', 'Before continuing, it’s important to be aware of the PricewaterhouseCoopers Oscar envelope protocol.\xa0', 'There are actually two sets of winners envelopes,\xa0handled at the ceremony by two representatives of PwC, in this case Cullinan and Martha Ruiz.', 'The company’s representatives are stationed on opposite\xa0sides of the stage, distributing envelopes to presenters depending on where they are entering from.\xa0', 'The most likely theory for what went wrong  is that Leonardo DiCaprio, who awarded  Stone her Oscar, got his envelope from one PwC rep and Warren Beatty was mistakenly given the duplicate best actress envelope on the opposite side of the stage when he went out to present best picture. ', 'The company\xa0released remarks\xa0Monday night expanding on an apology issued earlier in the day.', '“PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night’s Oscars. PwC Partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead of the envelope for best picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner,” the statement read in part, going on to apologize to all involved.', 'In a cruel bit of irony, Cullinan had spoken to the Huffington Post just days before the ceremony explaining\xa0that the announcement of a mistaken winner at the Oscars was “so unlikely.”', 'Onstage, Beatty and Faye Dunaway were left holding the bag. And by bag, we mean envelope. And by envelope, we mean envelope containing the lead actress winner.', '\nComplete list of Oscar winners', 'Upon seeing the results, Beatty clearly wasn’t sure how to proceed. He\xa0stalled. He\xa0looked\xa0past Dunaway offstage for help. He then showed his co-presenter the envelope\xa0—\xa0who, it should be noted, had asked to be able to read the winner — who seemed to think that Beatty was just hamming it up for the audience. It now seems more likely he was asking her to confirm that she was seeing what he was seeing but, unamused, Dunaway read the film title on the card,\xa0which was “La La Land,” as it was actually announcing Stone’s win.\xa0And things devolved from there.', 'Jaws dropped inside the Dolby Theatre.\xa0Backstage, pandemonium broke out.', 'Times reporter Jeffrey Fleishman witnessed a stagehand in the wings repeating, “Oh my god, he got the wrong envelope,” pacing the floor as the cast and crew of “La La Land” took the stage to unwittingly accept their erroneous award,\xa0suggesting that one of the PwC representatives immediately alerted others of the mistake.', 'But when precisely did “La La Land” producers Jordan Horowitz, Marc Platt and Fred Berger realize that their dreams were about to morph into some twisted nightmare?', 'Horowitz spoke first, thanking family and friends and making an impassioned plea for great art.', '“There’s a lot of love in this room, and let’s use it to create and champion bold and diverse work — work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope and towards empathy,” Horowitz said.', 'Platt took the mic next for his remarks and as he spoke, behind-the-scenes staff appeared to join the cast and crew onstage to explain what had gone wrong. Among them was\xa0Cullinan.\xa0', 'The official transcript from the academy states that as Platt is speaking, both Horowitz and Berger are shown the correct envelope and it is revealed to them that “Moonlight” has actually won the night’s top prize.', 'Platt, still oblivious, concluded\xa0his remarks, saying:\xa0“Repression is the enemy of civilization — so keep dreaming, because the dreams we dream today will provide the love, the compassion and the humanity that will narrate the stories of our lives tomorrow,” before ceding the spotlight to Berger.', '“Fred?” Platt stated, turning to Berger.', 'Berger hesitated, shook his head “No,”\xa0then proceeded to the microphone anyway.', 'The third “La La Land” producer thanked family and friends then, looked behind him to see that the jig was up.\xa0', '“We lost, by the way. But, you know. There’s a mistake,” Berger said with all the enthusiasm of someone who had just experienced a particularly arduous colonoscopy.', 'Congratulations “Moonlight”!', 'At this point Horowitz stepped in to try and stage-manage the historic gaffe, stating,  “This is not a joke” and, swiping the correct card from Beatty\xa0to\xa0display, before\xa0(accurately) announcing “Moonlight” as best picture.\xa0', 'Beatty tried to explain his part in the confusion and eventually the cast and crew of “Moonlight” took the stage.', '“Very clearly, very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, ’cause this is true. Oh my goodness,” said “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins upon finally taking the stage to receive the hotly contested award.', 'After the cameras turned off, those involved were still stymied by what took place.\xa0', 'Stone told reporters, “I was on such a buzzy plane backstage that I already felt like I was on another planet.', '“It was an incredible outcome, but a very strange happening for Oscar history.” \xa0', 'She also shared this tidbit, which added credence to the second envelope theory: “I also was holding my best actress in a leading role card, so I’m not sure what that was. Whatever story you’re hearing.”', 'As for Beatty, he\xa0told The Times after the show,\xa0“I looked down at the card and thought, \'This is very strange, because it says best actress.\' Maybe there was a misprint. I don\'t know what happened.”', 'Host Jimmy Kimmel had only kind things to say about the producers of “La La Land” after everything had been hashed out.', '“There was a lot of nuttiness. It was kind of like a dispute over a boxing match. You didn\'t know who won. You didn\'t know who the winner was. But I have to say the producers of \'La La Land\' were very gracious,” Kimmel said to The Times backstage.', 'But what about the actual people involved? What was it like for the creators of “Moonlight” to be robbed of their singular moment? And for those responsible for “La La Land” to have their dreams dashed in such painful fashion?', 'Those questions were answered when Horowitz\xa0crossed paths with Jenkins and “Moonlight” producer Jeremy Kleiner\xa0at the Governors Ball.', '“I wish you had your moment,” Horowitz told Kleiner, who hardly had time to utter anything during his film’s brief time on stage accepting the Oscar.', 'Kleiner told The Times that he loved “La La Land” and he loved his film but that the experience was different because of the flub.', 'Asked if it felt the same as winning in the traditional fashion, Kleiner shrugged and said, “It can’t. How can it?”', 'In contrast, Horowitz gave an acceptance speech for an award he didn’t receive and seemed shaken by the experience.', "“I'd like to watch it and see what happened.

President Donald Trump\'s prime-time address Tuesday night comes as Trump looks to reframe his presidency after a chaotic first month in office marked by a rocky rollout of his travel ban, disruption among his staff and ongoing hostility toward the press.', 'Trump has said he "inherited a mess" that only he can fix, but with the stock market up and unemployment down, experts say he has some convincing to do.', '"For Trump, things are actually going pretty well," said Michael Genovese, political science professor at Loyola Marymount University. "This is his chance to really chart a course for the future, and if he does it by tearing down America, I think a lot of people are going to find that to be unacceptable."', 'White House officials said the theme of Trump\'s address will be the "renewal of the American spirit," focusing on defense, immigration, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and creating economic opportunity.', "Historically, Genovese said, presidents have used the opportunity to inspire optimism and hope about the future — even in dire circumstances. Here's a look at how some tackled the challenges facing the nation in their first speeches to Congress:", 'President Barack Obama, Feb. 24, 2009:', 'Obama inherited the worst financial crisis the country had ever seen since the Great Depression. Millions of workers across the country were left gripped by anxiety after losing their jobs and their homes. The banking system was in shambles. Meanwhile, U.S. troops were still involved in grueling conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.', 'In his debut address, Obama carried a serious tone while tapping into the optimism and ambition that was a trademark of his campaign.', '"While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this," Obama said. "We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before."', "He laid out an expansive agenda, pledging to hold big banks accountable, reform health care, double the nation's supply of renewable energy and invest in the accessibility of education.", 'President George W. Bush, Feb. 27, 2001:', 'Americans were still reeling from the political turmoil of President Bill Clinton\'s impeachment-marked presidency when Bush entered office with a historically low approval rating coming off a contested election that led all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.', 'But in his address, Genovese said, Bush "ignored his critics and forged ahead."', 'Bush, who inherited a healthy economy, laid out an agenda that included the largest tax cut proposal since that of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, while also proposing more spending for defense, education and healthcare.', '"Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis," he said. "And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble."', 'President Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1993:', 'Clinton took office on the heels of the deadly race riots in Los Angeles, which erupted in April 1992 after a jury acquitted four police officers who were on trial for the beating of Rodney King.', 'Elected on his "It\'s the economy, stupid" platform in 1992, Clinton focused his 65-minute address largely on economic recovery and creating a half-million new jobs to put Americans back to work with a $30 billion stimulus, especially in cities and poor rural communities.', 'He also called for health care and welfare reform, spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy.', '"We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit," Clinton said. "And at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change. And now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them."', 'President George H.W. Bush, Feb. 9, 1989:', 'Bush inherited a large federal budget deficit, as well as the fallout from the Iran-Contra scandal, the biggest foreign policy blunder of the Reagan administration.', 'In his first address to a Democratic-controlled Congress, Bush struck an optimistic tone, saying he wanted to increase government spending for education, science and the environment while tackling homelessness and drug abuse.', '"We meet at a time of extraordinary hope," he said. "Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe. Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America."', 'President Ronald Reagan, Feb. 18, 1981:', 'Early in 1981, Americans felt defeated by the Iran hostage crisis. For 444 days, Islamic revolutionaries held 52 Americans captive after seizing the U.S. Embassy in 1979.', 'The hostages were freed the day Reagan assumed office. While that brought tremendous relief, the country faced an economic crisis comparable to what Obama inherited in 2009.', 'The year before Reagan took office, inflation was nearly 13 percent — in the double digits for a second year in a row. Millions of Americans were out of work. High interest rates were preventing people from buying homes.', 'While Reagan campaigned with a rosy slogan, "It\'s morning again in America," he painted a grim portrait of the economy during his first address.', 'Reagan equated the $1 trillion national debt to a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high and pointed to an "explosion" of government regulations he said hampered productivity.', 'In his narrowly focused speech, Reagan proposed sweeping cuts in almost every area of federal spending except defense, as well as a reduction in personal income taxes.', '"This, then, is our proposal—America\'s new beginning: a program for economic recovery," he said. "I don\'t want it to be simply the plan of my administration. I\'m here tonight to ask you to join me in making it our plan."', 'Members of Congress — who during his 33-minute speech interrupted him more than a dozen times with applause — responded with a standing ovation.

In the middle of the selfies and the on-screen tweets to President Trump and a thousand and one other whiz-bang technological tools to make the Oscars seem relevant to an audience with an ever-shortening attention span, the Academy Awards were betrayed this year by the simplest item you can imagine.', 'Yes, a piece of paper crashed the Oscars.', 'Not just any piece of paper, mind you. An envelope. Or to put it more precisely: The Envelope, that most ancient of Oscar rituals, a piece of physical media, printed, lacquered, matted, die-cut, hand-folded and, in the immortal words of Stevie Wonder, signed, sealed and delivered by the trusted partners of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.', 'Only this year, one of those partners handed the wrong envelope to presenter Warren Beatty. Baffled by its contents — the card contained the winner of the lead actress Oscar, not best picture — Beatty handed the envelope to co-presenter Faye Dunaway, who erroneously proclaimed “La La Land” the victor.', 'That envelope then ended up in the hands of “La La Land” producer Jordan Horowitz, who told me Monday that he didn’t bother looking at it or the card — because why would he? He simply held onto it because, in recent years, since the academy upgraded to fancy-schmancy stationery, that envelope has become as cherished a keepsake as the Oscar itself.', 'As well it should be. Last year’s Oscar envelopes, designed by\xa0Marc Friedland Couture Communications, required 110 man-hours (Person-hours? Can’t women construct these things too?) to create. That’s 110 hours … for one envelope, each costing about $200.', 'I’m not sure how that compares to this year’s set of stationery, which was made by a different company, perhaps the one George Costanza bought his wedding invitations from. There are reports that the 2017 Oscar envelope, sporting a lower contrast gold printing on a red background, making it harder to read, may have contributed to the biggest fiasco in the history of the Academy Awards.', 'When the correct envelope was finally produced, Horowitz held its contents up for all to see: “Moonlight.” Adele Romanski, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, producers. Best Picture.” (The point size for “Best Picture,” by the way, was annoyingly small.)', 'The ritual of the Oscar envelope, paraded down the red carpet in locked briefcases like Moses returning from the mountain, stone tablets in hand, dates to 1940. The year before, back in the day when the motion picture academy gave the press a list of winners beforehand, the Los Angeles Times leaked the winners prior to the ceremony. (You can’t trust the media!)', 'The winners were never much of a secret anyway, but from that point forward, the names were sealed in stationery, giving birth to the phrase “The envelope, please” and, later, split-screen cams designed to show us the victors’ joy and, sometimes, a nominee’s (there are no losers here) grumpiness. (We’re looking at you, Bill Murray.)', 'Other awards shows encase their winners’ names in paper too, but those envelopes have never captured the public’s fancy in the same way as the Oscars. That might be because the Academy Awards have always put its envelope-keepers, those pesky PricewaterhouseCoopers partners, in the spotlight, marching them down the red carpet and giving them a shout-out during the show. (Interestingly enough, this was the rare year when we didn’t see them during the telecast.)', 'Two years ago, Cate Blanchett spied PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Brian Cullinan and his locked briefcase on the red carpet and engaged him in a spirited tug-of-war over its contents. (This from an actress who was the safest bet that year to win an Oscar.)', 'Cullinan, a solid professional and likable guy, is apparently the one who handed Beatty the wrong envelope this year — meaning he might not be back at the Oscars in 2018.', 'But you can bet the envelopes will.', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

Google Inc. is stepping up its march to become a full-service entertainment destination with its YouTube TV service, which will enable subscribers to watch live feeds of top television networks for $35 a month.', 'On Tuesday the company unveiled its long-planned service, which is expected to launch in a few months with more than 40 television networks, including CBS, ABC, ESPN, Fox and NBC.', 'With its new offering, Google is taking direct aim at traditional television operators by designing a service that appeals to younger people who consume much of their entertainment on smartphones and who already spend countless hours watching YouTube videos.', '“There is no question that millennials love great TV content, but what we have seen is they don’t want to watch it in the traditional setting,” YouTube Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki said\xa0at the company’s Playa Vista campus.\xa0 “They don’t want to watch it with their families sitting in the living room waiting for their favorite show to come on.”', 'Google will join an already crowded field of Internet TV services that includes Apple TV, Sling TV, Sony PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now. The popular online video site Hulu also plans to launch its own “skinny” bundle of traditional TV channels within a few months.', '“This is partly a defensive move,” said James McQuivey, a media analyst with Forrester Research. “If you are Google, then you don’t want to stand by and watch the satellite-TV guys take this opportunity for themselves. If [Internet TV] going to happen, then Google wants to make it happen.” ', 'YouTube’s name recognition and Google’s technology and deep pockets could give its service a competitive advantage. The company has designed a sleek interface for its app to enable subscribers to record a show with a tap of a button. Its cloud-based DVR allows unlimited storage of TV shows or ballgames.', 'Google’s announcement underscores how far the Internet search giant has come in forging partnerships with Hollywood’s leading players. A decade ago, the big networks slammed their doors when Google tried to coax them into a relationship.', '“The whole reason that some of the broadcasters formed Hulu was to shut down the threat of YouTube,” McQuivey said. “Back then, in 2008, the TV networks said: ‘There is no way we are going to enable you, this rising superstar, to get into the TV business.’ ”', 'Studio chiefs were then  loath to turn over their valuable TV programming out of fear that their businesses would be ravaged, much like the\xa0newspaper and book publishing and music industries have been.', 'But times have changed. The networks’ longtime partners, pay-TV distributors including Dish Network, DirecTV and Charter Communications, have witnessed an exodus of customers who have cut the cord or opted for a lower-cost\xa0“skinny” bundle of channels. Younger consumers — those under 35 — seem less inclined to sign up for a fat bundle of cable channels, and Google has tapped into that audience in a big way.', 'Company executives did not specify when YouTube TV would launch, but said it would be sometime in the next few months.', 'Subscribers will be able to stream shows on their phone or Internet-connected TVs through the YouTube app.\xa0 One monthly subscription will allow six users to share a single account, a feature that is\xa0likely to please cash-strapped 20-somethings. YouTube TV will also have a cloud-based DVR to enable users to record and keep an unlimited number of shows.', 'The announcement had been widely expected. A Google TV service has been on the drawing board for nearly a decade, with engineers in San Bruno and Mountain View, Calif., spending the last two years perfecting the version that will launch in major U.S. cities.', 'CBS was one of the first major broadcasters to sign up for the service in October, and other networks and channels followed suit.\xa0In addition to the major networks, the service includes the Weather Channel and the various cable channels owned by NBCUniversal, Walt Disney Co. and 21st Century Fox. Spanish-language Telemundo also will be part of the service as well as the Weather Channel’s Local Now, a news, traffic and weather offering for some local markets.', 'However, cable channels operated by Time Warner Inc.\xa0— including HBO, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network\xa0— Viacom Inc.\xa0and Scripps Networks are not part of YouTube TV. ', 'The new service reflects a larger strategy by Google and YouTube, the world’s dominant video site, to become a bigger player in the mainstream TV business. ', '“This is part of the continuing evolution in how people think of YouTube,” said James Dix, a media analyst with Wedbush Securities. ', 'In 2015, Google launched the commercial-free service called YouTube Red for $10 a month.  The company said in February that it was introducing its own slate of original TV shows aimed at children and families, expanding the roster of original productions from YouTube Red.', 'With rising competition for eyeballs, YouTube can no longer rely on amateur videos to generate traffic and advertising revenue. So the video site has begun investing in and distributing original shows targeting young viewers — starting with teens and young adults — who are increasingly bypassing traditional television and movies.', 'Still, the most-viewed YouTube clip in 2016 was CBS’ late-night talk show host James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” session with music superstar Adele, Wojcicki said. The clip was viewed more than 150 million times on YouTube. Oscar clips generated more than 33 million views, executives added, on par with ABC’s television audience on Sunday night.', 'YouTube TV probably won’t be a huge moneymaker for Google — at least in the beginning, analysts said. However, the company will be able to glean insights about how young consumers watch live TV, including sports.', 'Top sports networks, including ESPN, Golf Channel and Fox Sports, will among the channels offered.', '“The issue for the TV industry is how do you get some of the people back in the pay-TV system — but Google doesn’t care about that,” Dix said. “It’s not going to be Netflix or revolutionize the TV viewing experience, but it is a way for Google to get in the game.”', 'YouTube has a potentially vast audience\xa0 — worldwide, its viewers are now watching more than 1 billion hours of video a day. But its foray into television faces hurdles, analysts said. ', 'YouTube has long been associated with free content, so convincing younger customers that they should pay for entertainment could be a challenge. It’s also playing catch-up with more established players like Netflix and Amazon and, so far, lacks premium channels that are hugely popular, such as HBO.', '"They are going to struggle to get younger people to pay.\xa0But the middle crowd, people in their 30s, have spent enough time watching Netflix for 10 bucks a month, and Amazon … so they might have concluded that getting access to these top shows is  worth it," McQuivey said. "And they have more money than people in their 20s."', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

The pitch of the voice was computer-altered, making the speaker sound a little like Donald Duck, but the message was hardly cartoonish.', '“In a short time, a large number of Jews are going to be slaughtered,”\xa0warned the squeaky-voiced caller to a Jewish community center, according to a recording from last month that was obtained by the Jewish\xa0Telegraphic Agency, a news service.', 'Threatening calls are pouring\xa0in to switchboards of Jewish schools and community centers with alarming frequency. Although authorities said no bombs had\xa0been located so far, the threats were tying up bomb squads and detectives, terrifying children who have been repeatedly evacuated from their classrooms and prompting some worried parents to withdraw their children.', 'The latest rash of threats on Monday hit 20 Jewish institutions in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia.\xa0It was the fifth round of similar threats that have come\xa0during the last two months, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has counted 90 bomb threats this year.', 'The Anti-Defamation League’s San Francisco office received a bomb threat Monday afternoon and evacuated its offices without incident, the organization said.', "“One threat or evacuation is one too many, and yet we’ve now seen more than 20 incidents in a single day not just to ADL, but to children's schools and community centers — and more than 90 incidents since the start of this year,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the league’s chief executive. “The level of threats and incidents is astounding\xa0and must not stand. We will do everything in our power to combat this wave of anti-Semitism.”", 'Some Jewish community centers in Northern California received calls several weeks ago, the organization said.', 'Monday’s bomb threats set nerves on edge coming on the heels of two separate incidents in Philadelphia and St. Louis where headstones in Jewish cemeteries were toppled.', 'Whoever is behind the bomb threats has stumped investigators with computer software that disguises the origins of the call and modifies the voice. Recipients of the threats have sometimes described them as coming from robocalls, although investigators believe that live callers are making repeated rounds of calls.', '“They were all eerily similar in their methodology…. They are leveraging technology, which makes the investigation difficult,”\xa0said Paul Goldenberg, who used to head a hate-crimes office for the state of New Jersey and is now in charge of investigating anti-Semitic threats for Jewish organizations.', 'In the past, Goldenberg said, anti-Semitic incidents would increase in reaction to events in the Middle East, such as Israeli incursions in Gaza or Lebanon, but the recent incidents appeared to have no such trigger.', '“I am a 20-year veteran of law enforcement, and these are extraordinary times…. I have never seen such an uptick in such a short period of time,” Goldenberg said.', 'Some analysts have tied the upsurge of hate crimes to the polarizing election of Donald Trump as president, but Naomi Adler, head of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, said it dated\xa0to 2015.', '“The\xa0rhetoric and disgusting speech began two years before the actual election at the beginning of the election season, but is not the whole explanation,” she said.\xa0“There is an incredible amount of anxiety and fear in our community.”', 'Over the weekend, more than 100 tombstones were toppled in the Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning by Aaron Mallin, a 36-year-old New Jersey accountant who arrived early to mark\xa0the\xa0anniversary of his father’s death.', '“I was shocked by what I saw,” Mallin said.\xa0“As I walked through the cemetery, I saw more and more gravestones that were toppled down. Some of the older, thinner stones were cracked.”', 'The extent of the damage suggests the attack was not simply the work of teenage pranksters, who frequently are blamed for toppling tombstones.', 'The phone rang Monday morning at the Levite Jewish Community Center outside Birmingham, Ala., and a receptionist answered it.

Pregnant minors would be unable to obtain an abortion without at least attempting to notify their parents under a measure that cleared the Indiana Senate on Tuesday.', "The first-of-its-kind abortion measure would drastically change the state's existing judicial waiver process, which allows someone under the age of 18 to pursue an abortion procedure with permission from the court system without notifying a parent or guardian.", 'It instead mandates that parents be served legal notice and have the opportunity to object in court — a move that supporters argue would strengthen parental rights.', 'But critics, including some Republicans, say allowing minors to have abortions without involving their parents is the entire point.', 'Tucked against a fence in an East Los Angeles cemetery, a long, flat headstone reads: “In memory of the 16,500 precious unborn, buried here, Oct. 6, 1985.”', 'The aborted\xa0fetuses had been found in a metal storage container repossessed from the Woodland Hills home of a former medical laboratory owner...', 'Tucked against a fence in an East Los Angeles cemetery, a long, flat headstone reads: “In memory of the 16,500 precious unborn, buried here, Oct. 6, 1985.”', 'The aborted\xa0fetuses had been found in a metal storage container repossessed from the Woodland Hills home of a former medical laboratory owner...', 'In some cases, they argue, the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape.

Karen Tallian. “It puts the parents back into the mix, when the whole purpose of the bypass was to keep them out of the mix.”', 'The measure cleared the Senate 36 to 13 on Tuesday, with four Republicans joining Democrats in opposing it. It now moves to the House for consideration.', "Republican state Sen. Erin Houchin, the author, contends her proposal protects the judge's ability to make a determination on the minor's petition and would not give parents veto power.", "There's nothing in the statute that prohibits them from being notified that a hearing is occurring, she said, and their presentation of evidence could give the judge more information to aid his decision.", 'As written now, notice would have to be served to a parent before a juvenile court hearing could occur. That notice could include registered or certified mail or other public means — like an advertisement placed in a newspaper.', 'The juvenile court could consider a petition after that notice is served, which would include an evidentiary hearing where parents could make arguments.', 'The measure would also give parents a path to legal recourse against individuals who aided their minor in obtaining an abortion without their consent.', 'Houchin and other antiabortion supporters say the proposal would rightfully involve parents in a process that could have a lasting effect on their child.', "“I've heard some talk that this is a bill about women's rights. This is a bill about parental rights,” Houchin said. “These are not women seeking abortions. They are children seeking abortions.”", 'Some discussion Tuesday centered on whether the bill would hold up in court, with some arguing the Supreme Court has previously agreed with parental involvement laws only if they include a confidential judicial bypass procedure.', 'Of the 36 states that require parental involvement and offer an alternative judicial bypass procedure for abortions, none mandate notifying parents that the minor is pursuing a bypass, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

(March 1, 2017)', 'As Joe Davis prepares to settle into the most hallowed vacant seat in Los Angeles sports history, he can take solace in one bit of decorative relief.', 'He won’t actually be sitting in Vin Scully’s chair. It just so happens that the Dodgers have chosen this season to renovate the Dodger Stadium broadcast booth.', '“I’m not replacing Vin Scully, nobody out there can replace him, there’s nobody yet  born who could replace him,” Davis said.', 'The  Dodgers’ new television broadcaster\xa0— who will formally begin filling the retired Scully’s spot Wednesday night for a spring training game against the San Francisco Giants on SportsNet LA at 5:05 p.m.\xa0— will also benefit from another change that will separate him from Scully’s shadow.', 'Davis will not work alone as Scully did, but instead will be joined during his 130-or-so games by either Orel Hershiser or Nomar Garciaparra.', '“While Vin thrived in that one-man role, it’s so tough, I can see how you don’t want anybody beside Vin even trying it,” Davis said.', 'So Davis is not trying to resemble Scully, and the Dodgers don’t want him to copy Scully, and resonating louder than all of that, the actual Vin Scully doesn’t want him to attempt Scully.', '“My prayer for him, for anyone, is maybe the hardest thing\xa0— be yourself,”  Scully said in a phone interview Tuesday. “When he starts, and for the 100 years he might be there, the big thing is to be yourself.”', '\xa0(We interrupt this column to report that in our conversation, Scully was as delightfully charming and sharp as ever, but definitely not coming back to work. Sorry.)', 'So, then, if  Davis is smartly determined to forge his own path, where does that path begin?', 'Start with his tender age and short resume. He’s 29, which makes him younger than even the majority of  Dodgers fans. Until he  worked 52 road games last year, he  had never been a play-by-play guy for a major league team. In fact, this April will mark the first time he has broadcast a game from Dodger Stadium in his life.', 'But, now, go to his clips, and listen. He’s good. He’s actually really good, with a distinct voice that booms like Joe Buck’s, a keen eye for detail, an appreciation for drama, and a youthful enthusiasm that makes the Dodgers sound not only credible and professional, but fun.', 'Go to YouTube, check out last year’s call on the incredible Yasiel Puig throw on which  the right fielder gunned down Trevor Story on an attempted triple in Colorado.', '“Story can fly. Puig can throw! My goodness! Yasiel Puig, from the wall!”', 'Then, silence.', '”He appears to be a fine young man, highly talented, I’m sure he will be welcomed by the fans, I certainly would pray for that,”  Scully said of Davis.', 'The guess here is that at least those fans who can watch the games on TV\xa0— more than half of the Los Angeles market will still be blacked out at the start of the season because of the awful TV deal\xa0— will certainly welcome Davis and embrace his back story.', 'While the Dodgers hired him after hearing him on Fox national  broadcasts\xa0— which he will still work, thus shortening his Dodgers schedule\xa0— his upbringing is small-town middle America.', 'He grew up in\xa0Charlotte and Potterville, Mich. \xa0— two tiny dots in the middle of the state. His father Paul was the football coach at Potterville High, Davis was the star quarterback and homecoming king, but his dream was to be a broadcaster, and he gravitated toward any microphone real or imagined.', 'He would provide play-by-play to his video games in his home. He would do play-by-play of sack races at high school pep rallies. At Beloit (Wis.) College, where he played quarterback and wide receiver, he would broadcast Ultimate  Frisbee games as if they were the ultimate. His first championships as a broadcaster were Illinois high school girls’ volleyball.', '“It is such a competitive industry, you have to do everything you can to set yourself apart,” he said.', 'A little luck also helps. Once, during his junior year in college, Davis wrote a letter seeking advice from Chicago Cubs television broadcaster Len Kasper. While attending a game at Wrigley Field, Davis attempted to deliver the letter to Kasper. But when he reached the press box, he realized it had fallen out of his pocket.', 'Later that night, while Davis was returning to his Michigan home, he was contacted by the owner of a Taco Bell across the street from Wrigley Field. The letter had been found on the street, and the store owner was so touched that she agreed to personally deliver it.', 'Sure enough, Kasper followed up, watched some tapes, and was impressed enough to serve as a valuable reference for Davis as he landed his first full-time paid job, as the play-by-play announcer for the double-A Montgomery (Ala.) Biscuits.', 'During his three years in Montgomery, he realized the power of the spoken word. Outside the Biscuits ballpark, a train would regularly chug past the left-field fence. Davis began noting the train’s appearance, at which point the train would “answer” him by blowing its whistle. Yeah, the  engineer was a big Biscuits fan with a transistor radio.', '“I love the challenge of capturing something in the moment and using it to connect with fans,” Davis said.', 'He quickly rose from Montgomery to ESPN to  Fox to the ears of Dodgers officials, who loved the powerful voice and fresh face.', '“He had a perspective we knew all Dodger fans would enjoy,” said Dodgers executive vice president Lon Rosen.', 'Davis  was officially hired in the fall of 2015, a year early to ease the transition, but\xa0so early that he couldn’t imagine even talking to Scully, much less replacing him.', 'So when Scully called to congratulate him, Davis didn’t recognize the number and didn’t answer the phone. Twice.', '“Joe, I’ve tried twice and not been able to get ahold of you so I believe I have started our relationship 0 for 2,” Scully said in the voicemail checked by the horrified Davis.', 'The men have since spoken several times, and will probably speak again before  opening  day, with Scully talking and Davis listening and all of Los Angeles hopefully understanding.', 'This\xa0is not about a torch passing.

And he sought to emphasize some of his proposals that may draw bipartisan support, such as lower-priced prescription drugs and paid family leave, prompting a rare ovation from Democrats in the room.', '“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,” he said. “Every problem can be solved.\xa0And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.”', 'The new president used\xa0his first address\xa0to a joint session of Congress to cast his short tenure\xa0as a series of promises made and kept to working Americans,\xa0and then went on to make even more. He vowed to deliver reforms that would “raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone.”', '“When we fulfill this vision … we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began,” he said.', 'The speech, which replaces a State of the Union during a president’s first year in office, provided Trump with the most formal occasion since his inauguration to sell his agenda to a public that remains sharply divided over his presidency. Trump remains popular with supporters, but his approval rating is historically low for a new president.', 'A single speech cannot be expected to turn around Trump’s presidency, which has suffered from early missteps and internal disorganization. But it may allow him a new opportunity to debate policies that many in his party have been yearning to discuss, creating new space amid some of Trump’s self-inflicted distractions.', 'In addition to immigration and healthcare, Trump also renewed his call for investing $1 trillion in roads, bridges and airports, promised significant tax cuts and called on Congress to pass a school choice plan that includes a voucher program popular among conservatives but loathed by Democrats. Trump also requested billions of dollars in spending increases on the military and veterans’ health. He intensified his call to deregulate businesses, drawing sharp lines with liberals who say those regulations protect worker safety and the environment.', 'The speech was vague, putting few details beyond broad prescriptions to make things better. And it will be nearly impossible to accomplish them all while still holding to Trump’s pledge to avoid adding to the federal budget deficit.', 'His vow to rewrite health policy epitomized\xa0the challenges ahead in turning rhetoric into reality. Trump promised to replace Obamacare “with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare.” The issue has vexed lawmakers from both parties who have struggled to provide both quality and access without driving up costs.', 'President Trump sees himself as a masterful dealmaker, and he has begun signaling\xa0that he believes he can\xa0land perhaps the thorniest of transactions in Washington: immigration reform.', 'Trump sparked a flurry of speculation when he privately\xa0told television anchors over lunch this week that\xa0he could...', 'President Trump sees himself as a masterful dealmaker, and he has begun signaling\xa0that he believes he can\xa0land perhaps the thorniest of transactions in Washington: immigration reform.', 'Trump sparked a flurry of speculation when he privately\xa0told television anchors over lunch this week that\xa0he could...', 'Trump’s demands included: ensuring coverage for those with preexisting conditions,\xa0tax credits and health savings accounts,\xa0more flexibility with Medicaid dollars for the states,\xa0changing laws to restrict malpractice lawsuits,\xa0and selling insurance across state lines.', 'Trump called his message one of “unity and strength,” after weeks in which he appeared preoccupied with relitigating battles\xa0from the campaign and antagonizing the media.', 'Aides said the text was informed by the union workers, coal miners and other working people Trump has met in his early days in the\xa0White House, a period that has also included numerous meetings with and high-level appointments of wealthy business executives.', 'For too long, Trump said, the middle class shrank as jobs moved overseas. Inner cities struggled and infrastructure crumbled as the nation’s leaders instead focused on defending “the borders of other nations” and “spent trillions of dollars overseas.”', 'His election, Trump said, was “an earthquake” resulting from the nation’s “quiet voices” rising up, and he promised to deliver on their behalf.', 'Trump challenged opponents who have bristled at his aggressive approach to tackling illegal immigration, including his “great, great” border wall. What, he asked, would they say to an American family that “loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?”', 'He continued to portray open borders as a dire threat to safety and security, highlighting three Californians whose relatives were killed by people in the U.S. illegally.', 'But he also said he believed that “real and positive immigration reform is possible,” suggesting openness to a more modern immigration system that would allow more skilled workers to enter.”', '“If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades,” he said.', 'The current legal immigration system heavily emphasizes\xa0family unification and is aimed at allowing in people from around the world striving to take advantage of American opportunity. By contrast, Trump advocated a system that would emphasize immigrants who already have skills the U.S. economy needs. The shift could also reinforce the goal of Trump’s nationalist advisors to alter the country’s demographics.', 'Trump also failed to mention the so-called Dreamers, the young people\xa0temporarily shielded from deportation under an immigration program created by President Obama. Trump vowed during the campaign to end protections for them but has publicly wavered several times, and his administration continues to issue work permits to those who apply and qualify for the program.', 'Trump opened his address with his most expansive condemnation to date of acts of violence and vandalism motivated by religious and racial bigotry.\xa0\xa0', '“We may be a nation divided on policies\xa0we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms,” he said, denouncing the spate of bomb threats to Jewish community centers and a shooting of two Indian men last week in Kansas.', "\n\nPresident Trump's first speech to Congress", 'The most powerful moment came when Trump acknowledged Carryn Owens, the widow of\xa0Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William “Ryan”\xa0Owens, who was killed\xa0Jan. 29 during a raid on a compound in Yemen used by Al Qaeda’s affiliate there.', 'William Owens, the Navy SEAL’s father, called for an investigation into the raid this week. The military has acknowledged that Yemeni civilians, including women and children, were also killed, along with 14 militants.\xa0', 'Congress gave a standing ovation as Carryn Owens\xa0looked up, tears in her eyes, her hands folded.

The officer’s behavior, he said, has become a “black eye” for the city of L.A.', '“For him to use that type of force and discharge his weapon is just unbelievable,” Kang said. “If we tell children not to escalate, tell your officers not to escalate off-duty as well.”', 'Larry Hanna, an attorney representing Ferguson, said the officer fired the shot to defuse an escalating situation. Ferguson had been punched in the face, Hanna said, and other teens were coming at him.', '“That’s why he then fires one round in a place where there’s nobody standing, in a downward direction to make people scatter. And that’s what happened,” Hanna said. “His aim was to make sure that nobody got hurt —\xa0him or anybody else.”', 'Officials in Anaheim and Los Angeles said they were troubled by what they saw on videos of the clash that\xa0were posted on YouTube and Facebook. As many as 300 protesters descended on the neighborhood last week, resulting in 23 arrests.', '“Like many, I am deeply disturbed and frankly angered by what it shows,” Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait said at a news conference. “The video shows an adult wrestling with a 13-year-old kid and ultimately firing a gun. … It should never have happened.”', 'The encounter unfolded around 2:40 p.m. Feb. 21\xa0along West Palais Road, Anaheim police said.

President Trump sees himself as a masterful dealmaker, and he has begun signaling\xa0that he believes he can\xa0land perhaps the thorniest of transactions in Washington: immigration reform.', 'Trump sparked a flurry of speculation when he privately\xa0told television anchors over lunch this week that\xa0he could support a compromise that allowed people with no criminal record to\xa0stay in the country and\xa0work and pay taxes.', 'Hours later, Trump made a last-minute addition to his high-profile speech before Congress, calling for an immigration overhaul that improves wages and increases security. \xa0', '“Real and positive immigration reform is possible,” he said. “…\xa0If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.”', 'But immigration experts are skeptical Trump has the attention span or the desire to pass\xa0a sweeping immigration overhaul, a deeply complicated undertaking that has failed twice in Washington in the last decade and would represent an about-face from Trump’s hard-line campaign stance against illegal immigration and crackdown on migrants since he took office.', '"It\'s not something I would take to the bank," said Angela Kelley, an immigration expert at the Open Society Policy Center. "If he\'s read his own executive orders, he would probably understand the skepticism.”', 'Trump’s actions in his first month in office set his administration on a path toward a harsh deportation program that is already sweeping up many of the same people that an immigration reform package would protect from removal.', 'During his first week, the president wiped away restrictions on immigration officers, opening the door to deportations for millions of immigrants in the country illegally, and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to hire 10,000 more deportation officers and 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.', 'Politically, Trump has little room to maneuver. Over the last 20 months, Trump propelled himself first to the Republican nomination for president and then to the White House by railing against illegal immigration, and he would face an uproar from his base if he signed a bill that created a pathway to citizenship for people in the country illegally. \xa0', '“There\'s a difference between sacrificing your principles to get a deal, and working with others, consistent with your principles, to get a deal,” White House Press Secretary Sean\xa0Spicer said.', 'President Trump’s well-delivered speech to Congress on Tuesday night answered one major question — whether he could offer the country a less divisive tone — but provided almost no clarity about how he hopes to fulfill the promises that he made in his campaign.', 'In addition to “massive” tax cuts...', 'President Trump’s well-delivered speech to Congress on Tuesday night answered one major question — whether he could offer the country a less divisive tone — but provided almost no clarity about how he hopes to fulfill the promises that he made in his campaign.', 'In addition to “massive” tax cuts...', 'He also would face unhappy Republican leaders in Congress, who are focused on big-ticket proposals on healthcare and tax reform, an agenda that could be derailed by a protracted debate over immigration.', 'Nevertheless, Trump\xa0told news anchors over chicken and spinach gnocchi in the White House that the “time is right for an immigration bill” and that positions on both sides need to be "softened,”\xa0according to a White House official present for the discussion.', 'The remark\xa0may have been mostly a reflection of Trump’s penchant for playing to his audience — in this case, journalists demanding answers about whether he can work with Congress on his top policy issue.', "“Frankly, one of the anchors said, ‘If anyone can get a deal, it would be you,’” Spicer told reporters Wednesday. “Obviously, he was pleased with that because it's true.”", 'Presidential speeches to joint sessions of Congress normally get meticulously scrubbed to ensure accuracy.

In past administrations, even minor misstatements have sometimes turned into major issues.', 'The Trump administration has a very different relationship with facts, as has been repeatedly documented....', 'White House officials emphasized that no new legislative reform effort was underway.', 'Trump has expressed a willingness to ease his stance on immigration before. He\xa0told senators\xa0as recently as two weeks ago that they should revive a 2013 proposal that passed in the Senate but died in the House.', 'And in a news conference last month, Trump wavered when asked whether\xa0he will end President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields from deportation some young people who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children.', '“The DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me because, you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and, you know, the law is rough,” Trump said.', 'In addition, despite his\xa0campaign promise to end the\xa0Obama-era program that gives work permits to those young people, known as “Dreamers,” Trump has allowed his administration to continue\xa0to issue them.\xa0', 'Top aides, however, have identified ways to end the program without Trump’s fingerprints, including through legal guidance issued by the departments\xa0of Homeland Security or Justice or through a lawsuit brought by states that the administration could decline to defend.', 'Immigration advocates, skeptical that Trump’s comment to news anchors presaged a\xa0shift in his hard-line approach,\xa0acknowledged he could use his negotiating powers to bring about a deal.', '"If he does open the door to immigration reform, he is perhaps uniquely positioned to pass immigration reform that eluded his predecessors, Obama and Bush,” said\xa0Alfonso Aguilar, head of the advocacy group Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.', 'Trump has the trust of immigration hard-liners, Aguilar noted, but he also has expressed a willingness to find a solution for people who are basically law-abiding and want to work in the country.', '“Ironically, perhaps, Trump is the one that can do it," Aguilar said.', 'Supporters see some consistency in Trump’s stance, pointing out that Trump has long believed tough enforcement and border security must come first, before any accommodation can be made for people in the country illegally.', 'The most significant new immigration proposal in his address to lawmakers was about revamping legal immigration, an overhaul that would require action by Congress.', 'Trump proposed tilting admissions into the U.S. toward skilled workers to allow in people who are less likely to use federal assistance or compete with low-wage workers. The current U.S. system favors family unification and those from around the globe who are striving to take advantage of American opportunity.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

But that number jumped to 2,500 in 2014 and soared to 4,000 a year later.', 'There has recently been a decrease in wastewater being injected deep underground, either because of regulatory actions or because oil and gas extraction has declined due to falling petroleum prices. That might be a reason for the decrease in the number of Oklahoma earthquakes last year, to 2,500.', 'In a statement, Mark Petersen of the USGS said the amount of injected wastewater in some areas has\xa0been reduced by up to 40% in 2016.', 'But the USGS report says the forecast\xa0earthquake hazard in 2017 “is still significantly elevated” compared to the seismic risk before 2009.', 'The\xa0Oklahoma Geological Survey’s director, Jeremy Boak,\xa0said in a statement that he expects that state directives to curtail wastewater injection rates and low oil prices “should result in further declines in the seismicity rate and limit future widespread seismic activity.”\xa0', 'A spokeswoman with a research and education program of\xa0the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America, Katie Brown, said in an email the reduced number of earthquakes “is a clear sign that the collaborative efforts between industry, scientists, and regulators are working.”', 'Accompanying the rise in Oklahoma’s earthquakes has been a significant jump in wastewater injected underground in increasingly deeper wells as oil companies have sought to extract untapped oil fields far underneath the state. Workers inject water at high pressure to break up the earth to tap into these deep oil wells, a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.', 'The petroleum harvest from these wells are a mix of not only oil and gas but salt water — all part of the stew of ingredients that come from the decomposed biological components of ancient oceans, said USGS research geophysicist Justin Rubinstein, deputy chief of the agency’s induced seismicity project.\xa0', 'Recent harvests have had a high percentage of salt water in them — requiring oil companies to deal with a significantly larger amount of wastewater than they’ve had to before. But as more wastewater has been injected deeper into the earth, underneath the ground water table, the number of earthquakes have risen in Oklahoma. ', 'Increased fluid deep underground can change the pressures on earthquake faults in a way that essentially lubricates them, making them more likely to move and resulting in an earthquake, Rubinstein said.\xa0', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

A 22-year-old immigrant who was in the process of renewing her status to remain in the country legally was detained by immigration agents Wednesday shortly after she spoke at a news conference of her hope that “Dreamers”\xa0and other immigrants be given a path to citizenship.', 'Daniela Vargas, an Argentine citizen who was brought to the county when she was 7 and later received protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Jackson, Miss.,\xa0as she and a friend drove from a rally and news conference, according to her attorney,\xa0Abigail Peterson.', 'Two law enforcement vehicles pulled over Vargas and her friend just minutes after they left the event\xa0organized by immigration attorneys, pastors and activists outside Jackson City Hall.

After handcuffing her, agents later released her.', '“They released her because she had a pending DACA case,” Peterson said. “What changed between then and two weeks later is the big question.”', 'Vargas, who has no criminal history and hopes to become a math professor, was granted DACA status in 2012 and again in 2014, according to Peterson. The Obama administration program, for immigrants brought into the country illegally as children, allows them to work legally and shields them from deportation.\xa0', 'In November, Vargas’\xa0DACA status expired as she tried to save up the $495 fee to renew it. After she raised enough money, her law firm filed a renewal application in February.', 'In a statement, Thomas Byrd, a public affairs officer for ICE, described Vargas as an “unlawfully present Argentinian citizen” who was taken into custody during a “targeted immigration enforcement action.”', 'During the Feb.\xa015 encounter, “ICE exercised discretion to not take her into custody due to her claim that she had DACA,” Byrd said. “Subsequent to this encounter, ICE verified that Ms. Vargas does not currently have approved DACA status.”', 'A federal immigration judge will now determine Vargas’ custody status, as well as whether she is eligible for immigration relief, Byrd said.', 'Vargas’ detention immediately drew questions from some Democratic senators. “Talking publicly about fears of deportation is not a crime and should not get someone detained,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter.\xa0', '“Disturbing that ICE may have followed her from an immigration press conference," tweeted Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).', 'Vargas is the latest target in a series of immigration enforcement operations across Mississippi. Last week, ICE agents detained 55 people on what were described as immigration-related charges as they executed criminal search warrants at a string of Asian restaurants in the\xa0central part of the state.', 'Still, the detention of Vargas took many, including her attorney, by surprise.', 'While President Trump pledged on the campaign trail to tighten controls on illegal immigration and immediately terminate the DACA program started by President Obama, he had seemed to adopt a softer stance on the so-called Dreamers\xa0in recent weeks.\xa0', '“We’re going to deal with DACA with heart,” Trump said at a news conference two weeks ago.', 'This week the president touted stepped-up border enforcement, but in a meeting television anchors also said that he could support a compromise that allowed people with no criminal record to stay in the country and work and pay taxes.', 'A federal magistrate has refused to release from custody a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant whose case has drawn an international audience —\xa0first, because he has been\xa0accepted in a\xa0program that shields “Dreamers” from deportation, and now because his attorneys allege\xa0officials altered documents to...', 'A federal magistrate has refused to release from custody a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant whose case has drawn an international audience —\xa0first, because he has been\xa0accepted in a\xa0program that shields “Dreamers” from deportation, and now because his attorneys allege\xa0officials altered documents to...', '“I would never have imagined that this would have happened,” Peterson said, noting that when she talked to Vargas about the news\xa0conference, she “perhaps naively” assumed that “things would continue under Trump based on what he said, which is that he cares about these DACA kids and he wants to protect this program.”', 'She added, “I hope it’s not representative of what the Trump administration stands for. If we’re not exercising discretion for people like Daniela, then where do we exercise discretion?”', 'Ramiro Orozco, an immigration attorney based in Jackson who coordinated Wednesday’s news conference, said he believed ICE agents detained Vargas to retaliate against her for speaking out about Dreamers.', '“I believe she was targeted,” he said. “I believe this is a maverick, rogue office in Pearl, Miss., emboldened by the federal policy memos.

The Trump administration\xa0Wednesday sent\xa0its strongest signal yet that it was prepared to buck\xa0the international trade order, including confronting the World Trade Organization, to assertively defend the economic interests and sovereignty of the United States.', 'In a mandated annual report to Congress outlining\xa0the president’s trade agenda, the administration repeated Trump’s warnings that the U.S. would take tough measures to combat dumping and other unfair practices by trading partners\xa0and ensure a level playing field.', 'The document, like Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday, was striking in its\xa0lack of specifics on what actions the president\xa0intended to take.\xa0', 'At the same time, the administration\xa0gave\xa0notice to the rest of the world that the U.S. would no longer tolerate distortions in global markets and that it stood\xa0ready\xa0to\xa0make a radical break from the past by emphasizing U.S. laws instead of deferring to global trading rules set by the WTO. The organization\xa0regulates trade and settles disputes among the more than 150 member nations, including the U.S.', 'Trump has criticized the WTO before, but Wednesday’s report took pains to diminish the authority of the Geneva-based body. The report noted that the WTO rules were written with the understanding that participating countries\xa0would abide by free-market principles and be transparent about their regulatory systems, when\xa0in fact that’s not the case with some.', '“The hope was that such a system could obtain better treatment for U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. Instead, we find that in too many instances, Americans have been put at an unfair disadvantage in global markets,” the report said.\xa0', '“Under these circumstances, it is time for a new trade policy that defends American sovereignty, enforces U.S. trade laws, uses American leverage to open markets abroad, and negotiates new trade agreements that are fairer and more effective both for the United States and for the world trading system, particularly those countries committed to a market-based economy.”', 'The administration said specifically that one of its key trade policy objectives would\xa0be “resisting efforts by other countries -- or members of international bodies like the World Trade Organization -- to advance interpretations that would weaken the rights and benefits of, or increase the obligations under, the various trade agreements to which the United States is a party.”', 'Congressional Democrats roundly criticized Wednesday’s report for failing to provide details, while some also expressed concerns\xa0that the Trump White House was staking out an extreme position.', '“It sounds like the administration is considering a far too drastic response,” said a statement by Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts,\xa0the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), the trade subcommittee’s ranking member.\xa0', '“We need to fix the problems with the current international trading system, not scrap the system altogether,” they said.', 'Nate Olson, trade director at the Stimson Center, a think tank, sounded\xa0alarmed.', '“It’s downright disingenuous — and dangerous — to claim a mandate for breaking faith with the WTO,” he said. “Trade wars break out when the rules of the game are unclear or purposely undermined. That strengthens nobody.”', 'The 336-page report, which also provided highlights of\xa0trade activities\xa0in 2016, was issued by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the president’s main agency\xa0on trade.', 'The report said a more detailed account of Trump’s trade agenda will be provided later, after the Senate has confirmed a trade representative.\xa0Trump has picked Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and negotiator, for the post, but a hearing on the\xa0nomination has yet to take place.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Assembling a mock draft before the NFL scouting combine is a risky proposition.', 'Many players rise and fall with their performance at the league’s annual evaluation event, their campus pro days, and depending on how deeply teams weigh into the free-agent market. Still, who can resist a little fantasy football?', 'This pre-combine mock has just one quarterback going in the first round, one player each from UCLA and USC, and a whopping five from Alabama.', 'The landscape will shift between now and the end of April, perhaps significantly, but here’s one snapshot of how the opening round could unfold:', '1. CLEVELAND — Myles Garrett, DE, Texas A&ampM:\xa0 A blue-chip pass rusher has eluded the Browns just as much as a franchise quarterback has.', '2. SAN FRANCISCO — Reuben Foster, ILB, Alabama: This pick could be Jonathan Allen, but 49ers have used top pick on a defensive lineman the past two years.', '3. CHICAGO — Jonathan Allen, DT, Alabama:\xa0 The Bears go for the best available defensive player because there’s no value at quarterback here.', '4. JACKSONVILLE — Jamal Adams, SS, Louisiana State: If the Jaguars don’t re-sign Johnathan Cyprien, they might grab a replacement for him here.', '5. TENNESSEE — Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan:\xa0 Titans don’t have a second-round pick, so they might try to trade out of this spot. But Davis would help.', '6. N.Y. JETS — Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State:\xa0 The Jets, who need help at corner, haven’t used their top pick on an offensive player since Mark Sanchez in 2009.', '7. CHARGERS — Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford:\xa0 The Chargers need to keep building their pass rush, and Thomas would be an disruptive bookend to Joey Bosa.', '8. CAROLINA — Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State:\xa0 Panthers want to reduce the number of hits on Cam Newton, and adding a dangerous running back would be one way.', '9. CINCINNATI — Mike Williams, WR, Clemson: The Bengals are still in search of a No. 2 receiver to replace Marvin Jones. A welcome move for A.J. Green.', '10. BUFFALO — Malik Hooker, FS, Ohio State:\xa0 Bills could go quarterback or receiver here, but Sean McDermott prioritizes safeties in his defense and Buffalo needs to get younger and better there.', '11. NEW ORLEANS — Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan:\xa0 Sean Payton has said getting an edge rusher is “a must” for Saints. Charlton’s size (6-6, 273) is a good fit for scheme.', '12. CLEVELAND — Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson:\xa0 Browns could pick up a\xa0 quarterback in a trade (paging Jimmy Garoppolo) or free agency, but if not… Hue Jackson likes the dual-threat Watson.', '13. ARIZONA — Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama:\xa0 The Cardinals are still looking for an able sidekick to cornerback Patrick Peterson. Receiver is a possibility too.', '14. INDIANAPOLIS — Takkarist McKinley, DE, UCLA:\xa0 The Colts don’t have a pure pass rusher under contract. The explosive McKinley would address that need.', 'The half mile or so that leads you from Hall A to Hall K is full of distractions. There are sessions on “Deadly Dust” … “A Safer Look at Welding” …\xa0 “A Safety Manager’s Guide to Millennials” …', 'A cardboard cutout of Pope Francis has instructions on how to find a worship area.', 'But, no offense to...', 'The half mile or so that leads you from Hall A to Hall K is full of distractions.

PHILADELPHIA — Sidney Jones, CB, Washington:\xa0 The Eagles are looking for a cornerback who could step into a starting role right away, and Jones is capable of doing that.', '16. BALTIMORE — Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee: The need for an elite edge rusher is more pressing than for a receiver,  although the Ravens would like both.', '17. WASHINGTON — Malik McDowell, DT, Michigan State: The Redskins want to fortify the interior of their defensive line. McDowell is quick enough to cause problems in the backfield.', '18. TENNESSEE — Teez Tabor, CB, Florida:\xa0 Again, the Titans are likely to bail out of one of their first-round picks. They want a corner, and probably could more easily address their receiver need in free agency.', '19. TAMPA BAY — Leonard Fournette, RB, Louisiana State: Fournette could also wind up in Carolina. Regardless, the Buccaneers need a running back, particularly with the uncertainty surrounding Doug Martin.', '20. DENVER — Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford:\xa0 The Broncos could go tackle, tight end, or defensive line. But this would be an intriguing landing spot for the multi-purpose McCaffrey, although it could be early for him.', '21. DETROIT — Charles Harris, DE, Missouri:\xa0 If one of the running backs were to slide, Lions could go in that direction. But they need help in their front seven, and Harris would provide that.', '22. MIAMI — Zach Cunningham, OLB, Vanderbilt:\xa0 It’s too early for the Dolphins to address their need at guard, so they go for a linebacker who can shore up their run defense.', '23. N.Y. GIANTS — O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama:\xa0 The Giants haven’t gotten enough production out of their tight ends. Howard would give them a big boost, as would Miami’s David Njoku.', '24. OAKLAND — Caleb Brantley, DT, Florida:\xa0 Despite the outstanding performance of Khalil Mack, the Raiders still finished last in the league in sacks (25). They need interior pass rush.', '25. HOUSTON — Ryan Ramczyk, T, Wisconsin:\xa0 The Texans could take a quarterback here, but right tackle might be a safer pick. They’ve done pretty well with big guys from Wisconsin.', '26. SEATTLE — Garrett Bolles, T, Utah:\xa0 The Seahawks have made do on the offensive line for long enough. They need to turn their attention to need there, and Bolles has the nastiness to succeed.', '27. KANSAS CITY — Raekwon McMillan, ILB, Ohio State:\xa0 The Chiefs are going to have to find an eventual replacement for Derrick Johnson. Don’t rule out a quarterback here.', '28. DALLAS — Adoree’ Jackson, CB, USC:\xa0 The Cowboys are in need of help in the secondary and should wind up taking the best player available. Jackson’s speed and ability to make an immediate special teams impact are enticing.', '29. GREEN BAY — T.J. Watt, OLB, Wisconsin:\xa0 The Packers will be taking an especially hard look at the outside linebackers and cornerbacks. Watt’s pedigree is compelling.', '30. PITTSBURGH — Tim Williams, OLB, Alabama:\xa0 Williams, who plays around 235 pounds, is a little on the light side, but he would fit the Steelers’ scheme as an edge rusher.', '31. ATLANTA — Carl Lawson, DE, Auburn:\xa0 Lawson would be the next brick in the rebuilding process for the Falcons’ defensive line. He’s a physical specimen who can get to quarterbacks.', '32. NEW ENGLAND — Jabrill Peppers, S, Michigan:\xa0 Peppers has the kind of versatility that Bill Belichick likes, a hybrid who can line up at either safety or linebacker. He needs to run well at the combine.', 'sam.farmer@latimes.com', 'Follow Sam Farmer on Twitter\xa0@LATimesfarmer

After complaints that the state is doing little to stop deadly hospital outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said this week that it would prioritize inspections at those facilities with high rates of patient infections.', 'The state disclosed the changes in a Tuesday letter to Consumers Union. The national nonprofit group had filed a petition with the state early this year listing scores of hospitals with abnormally high infection rates that had not been inspected in five years.', 'On Wednesday, Consumers Union called the state’s response “an important first step” that still did not go far enough to protect the public.', '“For too long, the state has relied on voluntary efforts by hospitals to lower infection rates, and that clearly hasn’t been working,” said Lisa McGiffert, who directs the group’s Safe Patient Project. “Now it’s time for the state to use its enforcement power to require poor performing hospitals to take action and keep patients safe.”', 'State law requires hospitals to be inspected every three years.', 'Consumers Union used state records to find that 131 California hospitals had not been inspected within the last five years. Eighty of those hospitals have reported infection rates that are significantly higher than other facilities, the group found according to its petition.', 'In its letter to the group, the state public health department said it was already working on catching up on inspections at those hospitals. State officials were now prioritizing inspections based on the hospitals’ reported rate of infections and how much time had\xa0passed since the last review, the letter said.', "“This prioritization will occur until all hospitals are resurveyed every three years,” wrote Scott Vivona, the department's acting deputy director.", 'Consumers Union looked at rates of a handful of dangerous types of hospital-acquired infections that facilities must report under a 2008 law, including the superbugs Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.', 'Because of limited infection-reporting requirements, state officials don’t know how many Californians are sickened by bacteria or other pathogens while in the hospital. They estimate that as many as 9,000 Californians die each year from hospital-acquired infections — a number that experts say may be low.', 'In the petition, Consumers Union asked the state to fine hospitals that did not report infections and deaths caused by contaminated medical devices.', 'Last year, a U.S. Senate investigation found that not one of the 16 or more American hospitals experiencing outbreaks caused by medical devices known as duodenoscopes had properly reported those events as required by federal law.', 'In his letter, Vivona said that language in the current state law has hampered the health department’s ability to penalize hospitals for not reporting problems that cause deaths or serious injuries.', 'State officials are developing rules that would guide hospitals on how they must report serious infections and other adverse events, he said.', '“We are constantly striving to find better ways to protect patients,” said Karen Smith, the department’s director, on Wednesday. “Our ongoing work with healthcare facilities to reduce and eliminate preventable infections is a cornerstone of this commitment. Healthcare associated infections are a serious public issue and have long been a top priority for the department.”\xa0', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

The Los Angeles City Council approved a package of new measures Wednesday to rein\xa0in mansionization, the long-debated phenomenon where large\xa0homes are built on older streets with comparatively small lots.', 'Council members unanimously rewrote two ordinances that regulate\xa0the size of new homes on\xa0hillsides and in single-family neighborhoods.', 'The changes\xa0were backed by Councilman Paul Koretz, who is running for a third term in Tuesday’s election.\xa0Koretz’s 5th District includes neighborhoods that have been incensed over the tearing down of historic homes and the construction of larger\xa0replacement houses.', '“The giant, boxy homes we’ve seen throughout Council District 5 will not be permittable any longer,” he said.', 'The mansionization measures will reduce the size of homes allowed in most single-family residential areas. For example, in some locations, the measure will scale back the square footage allowed for houses to 45% of the overall lot, down from 50%.', 'Lawmakers also stripped the existing law of key provisions that have allowed property owners to obtain additional square footage for their new home projects.', 'Activists from a handful of neighborhoods applauded the vote, complaining that owners of towering homes infringe\xa0on the privacy of people next door.\xa0“The city has responded to a grass-roots movement,” said\xa0Robert\xa0Eisele, vice president of the La Brea Hancock Homeowners Assn.', 'Still, some who attended the council meeting complained that many homeowners have been left in the dark on the new restrictions. And a trio of neighborhood groups contend the law also includes\xa0a new exemption\xa0for property owners who want to get around the size\xa0restrictions.', 'Under the ordinance approved Wednesday, property owners could seek to circumvent the new restrictions by applying for a conditional use permit, a document that takes extra time and money to obtain, said Doug Carstens, an attorney for the Sunset Coalition and two other organizations.', '“They went through all this time and effort to satisfy neighborhoods and protect people, but at the same they’ve included a huge loophole that goes a long way toward undoing those protections,” he said.', 'Carstens warned council members that the exemption had not been properly vetted as required under the California Environmental Quality Act.

Mike Feuer to rewrite sections of two city ordinances that regulate the size of new homes', 'Spurred by years of complaints from neighborhood groups, the Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to seek new restrictions on “mansionization” — the practice of constructing houses that are far larger than those nearby.', 'On a 13-0 vote, lawmakers asked City Atty. Mike Feuer to rewrite sections of two city ordinances that regulate the size of new homes in single-family neighborhoods and in hillside areas.', 'The changes were spearheaded by Councilman Paul Koretz, who represents neighborhoods stretching from the Westside north to Encino.\xa0Koretz, who began pushing for the changes in May 2014, said he has received more complaints about mansionization than about all of the other issues in his district combined.', 'Koretz said constituents have bombarded his office with complaints about\xa0“very boxy, ugly homes”\xa0that loom over their neighbors. The homes are being built\xa0by developers who “just want to put in as many bedrooms in as possible so they can make a huge profit,” he said.', '“That’s in the interest of speculators. But it’s not in the interest of homeowners\xa0in the district, and we’re trying to help them,” Koretz added.', 'My neighborhood is called either Fairfax Village or Mid-City West or Melrose or maybe all three. It is just north of the Grove and Park LaBrea, just south of West Hollywood. Since I work from home I often take walks nearby to unwind, and they’re usually pleasant, though lately I’ve had to take...', 'My neighborhood is called either Fairfax Village or Mid-City West or Melrose or maybe all three. It is just north of the Grove and Park LaBrea, just south of West Hollywood. Since I work from home I often take walks nearby to unwind, and they’re usually pleasant, though lately I’ve had to take...', 'Neighborhood activists had worried in recent days that council members would water down some of the home-size restrictions recommended last summer by the City Planning Commission, a panel made up of mayoral appointees. But Koretz, working with Councilmen Herb Wesson, David Ryu and Jose Huizar, preserved the commission’s proposals.', 'One mansionization measure\xa0backed by the council would reduce the\xa0square footage allowed for houses in R-1 zones\xa0—\xa0areas where only single-family homes are permitted — to 45% of the overall lot size, down from 50%.', 'The council also moved to eliminate provisions that have allowed homebuilders to obtain additional square footage for their projects. For example, developers have had the right to go 20% bigger when they showed they followed environmentally friendly design standards. That would disappear under the council’s plan.', 'City lawmakers first approved a package of mansionization rules in 2008. At the time, they said it would help preserve\xa0the look and character of existing neighborhoods —\xa0particularly those developed between the 1910s and the 1940s. But critics quickly concluded that the ordinance was riddled with loopholes.\xa0They voiced dismay that some portions of a house, such as an attached garage or a covered porch,\xa0did not count toward its\xa0overall size.', 'With the real estate market surging in recent years, residents in older neighborhoods watched with alarm as scores of older homes —\xa0Spanish Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival and other styles —\xa0were torn down and replaced with much bigger houses.', '“Every time a house goes up for sale, we’re terrified,” said Deni Mosser, a web designer who lives near South Robertson Boulevard.', 'Opponents of the mansionization measure say there is a demand for bigger homes —\xa0and not just by speculators. Families frequently don’t want their kids sharing bedrooms, and they entertain more at home than they did decades ago, said Daniel Bibawi, who works in a West Los Angeles architecture firm.', '“To cram four\xa0or five\xa0people into an 1,100-square-foot house, one of these old bungalows, it’s a joke really,” he said.', 'City officials expect the council to cast a vote on new ordinance language early next year. Bibawi said many of his clients are trying to get their home construction projects approved before those\xa0changes take effect. “They’re worried they’re not going to get to build what they want,” he said.', 'Still, others argued that the mansionization measure does\xa0not go far enough. Some who attended Wednesday’s council meeting said the city should no longer exclude garage space, or a portion of a garage,\xa0from the overall calculation of a new home’s square footage.', 'Miki Jackson, a consultant with the Coalition to Preserve L.A., told city lawmakers they should also focus on protecting older apartment buildings, particularly those covered by the city’s law limiting rent increases. Jackson’s group is pushing a March 7 ballot measure to crack down on some large-scale development projects.', '“We have a historic, unique, L.A. type of housing — duplexes, courtyards,\xa0triplexes — that are being destroyed for mansions all over the city,” she said. “We’re losing this important resource,\xa0and I think it\xa0should be very, very hard to destroy rent-stabilized housing of any kind.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

(March 1, 2017)', 'Uber founder Travis Kalanick has run\xa0his hyper-competitive business under the assumption the ride-hailing service that reigns supreme will be the one\xa0with the cheapest rates and best service.', 'On that count, the 40-year-old chief executive has won handily. Uber has the most cars on the road and often the lowest prices.', 'But in recent months, the San Francisco firm has discovered customers care about more than just cost and service. People have to actually like your brand. But that’s hard to do when your company is battered by one self-inflicted controversy after another.', 'Since the start of the year alone, Uber has\xa0had to address criticism over:', 'In the latest spat, Kalanick lashed back at a driver who said he had lost money working for Uber’s\xa0high-end black car service.\xa0“Some people don\'t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],” he told the driver.\xa0“They blame everything in their life on somebody else.”', "CEO Travis Kalanick is seen discussing Uber's business model with a driver in a dashcam video obtained by Bloomberg News. The discussion begins at 3:50 in the video.", "CEO Travis Kalanick is seen discussing Uber's business model with a driver in a dashcam video obtained by Bloomberg News. The discussion begins at 3:50 in the video.", 'The embattled company\xa0is now fighting to retain drivers and customers while\xa0dealing with an image crisis that would make most Fortune 500 leaders lose their lunch. Its sweet justice for critics of the company, which has\xa0ignored regulators, clashed with legacy taxi providers and declined to guarantee its drivers a minimum wage. Uber’s winner-take-all attitude may have helped it become the nation’s biggest ride-hailing service, but now\xa0it seems\xa0to be\xa0scaring away consumers with a conscience.', '“By focusing solely on the next round of funding and speedy economic growth, the company seems to have left behind what matters the\xa0most: people,” Fabian Geyrhalter, the head of Los Angeles-based branding agency Finien, said of Uber’s treatment of its employees, drivers and clientele.', 'When Uber launched in 2009,\xa0its service and technology was novel: tap your smartphone, get a ride from a friendly driver in a clean vehicle with new-car smell, all for a price comparable to a taxi.', "But “today, the only brand attribute left is 'cheap' and the Uber brand took a massive hit because of greed and a one-track mind that left the life force of a functioning company behind,” Geyrhalter said.", 'The negativity doesn’t just hit ridership, which witnessed a reported loss of\xa0more than 200,000\xa0users since Kalanick showed willingness to work with the president.\xa0Experts say\xa0it could also weaken the company’s ability to recruit talented employees, particularly women. Moreover, it’s already weighing\xa0on the patience of Uber’s investors, who see Kalanick’s abrasive leadership style and the questionable culture it fosters as an eventual\xa0impediment to a successful public company one day. Venture capitalists Mitch and Freada Kapor published a letter last week describing Uber’s culture as “toxic.”', '“Travis is competing in several markets here,” said Duncan Davidson, general partner at Bullpen Capital, which is not an investor in Uber.\xa0“One is competing with Lyft and taxies. The other is competing for capital. And the third is talent. This is going to hurt him.”', 'None of this is particularly shocking to anyone who has followed Kalanick, whose cutthroat reputation and Ayn Rand worldview\xa0hasn’t engendered much goodwill\xa0outside of Libertarian circles and venture capitalists’ offices. Apple’s Steve Jobs wasn’t particularly liked either because of his caustic management style, but his products were so transformative that he was labeled a genius above all else.', 'Kalanick doesn’t have that luxury. Ride-hailing just isn’t that sexy. And so the chaos at his company is seen as a reflection of his leadership.\xa0', '“Leaders create the weather and they control the weather,” said Scott Eblin, an executive leadership coach who has also written bestselling books on the topic. “If you\xa0look at Uber’s history and how aggressive they’ve been in their expansion, it wasn’t that surprising that they’ve run into trouble because it’s a super aggressive, takes-no-prisoners kind of culture. That starts with Kalanick. It’s played out to its logical conclusion.”\xa0', 'Davidson said the missteps\xa0put more pressure on Kalanick than ever before\xa0to change his act.', '“He created this bad boy culture, he broke the rules and was able to defeat the taxi cab industry, and everyone applauded him for it, but he’s going to start getting in trouble now,” Davidson said. “Like Trump has to get more presidential, Travis needs to start being a leader, and not be a feisty little start-up bad boy. It’s a transition everybody has to make, and he’s taken way too long to make it.”', 'Uber did not respond to a request for comment, but Kalanick issued an apology Tuesday night for the argument with his driver caught on video.', '“To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,” Kalanick\xa0wrote. “It’s clear this video is a reflection of me.… I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.”', 'A more carefully cultivated public image can\xa0make a difference. Consider Uber’s chief rival, Lyft. Neither of the privately held, venture-backed\xa0companies\xa0offers benefits to its drivers, perhaps the most controversial aspect of the ride-hailing business model. Yet Lyft has succeeded in promoting a softer image with its plush, pink mustachioed vehicles. In an industry where there’s little difference between competitors, Uber is leaving money on the table simply because Lyft is viewed as being nice.\xa0', 'Uber’s belligerence is so well-known in Silicon Valley that competitors don’t even have to bring it up as a point of differentiation any more when it comes to recruiting and retaining talent, according to sources at Lyft, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter.', 'The question now is how long the backlash will last.', "After Uber\xa0appeared to advertise low fares during a taxi workers strike at John F. Kennedy International Airport protesting President Trump's travel ban, the hashtag #deleteUber trended and thousands of users removed the app from their phones (Lyft was there too, but few complained, likely because of the company’s comparatively benign reputation).", "Tiffany Seeley, 27, was one of those users. The UX designer and fan of Uber's design said she deleted her account after learning about the company's response to the Trump administration’s travel ban and in protest of Kalanick's participation on the president’s\xa0economic advisory council. She even wrote the CEO a letter, she said.", 'But within about a week, Seeley said, she was back to using Uber.', '“I realized I needed it,”\xa0she said, describing the convenience of hailing an Uber from her loft in downtown L.A. and being picked up and dropped off without having to think about it. "It\'s all done for me."', 'With a valuation of $68 billion compared with Lyft’s $5.5 billion, Uber isn’t likely to lose\xa0its dominance any time soon. But the controversies could ultimately diminish that valuation. Kalanick, experts say, will have to show a humbler side of the company moving forward if it hopes to extend its growth.\xa0', '“Arrogance works if you’re Babe Ruth and you hit a home run where you pointed or you’re Muhammad Ali and you get a knockout in the first round,” said Ira Kalb, a professor of marketing at USC. “If you don’t deliver on arrogance, that’s when the marketplace is very unforgiving.

Other programming deals are expected to follow after Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange as it tries\xa0to raise money to fuel growth while giving its early investors a healthy return.\xa0', 'Just last month, Discovery signed a pact to make shows for Snapchat, including programming inspired by its famous shows including “Shark Week” and “Mythbusters,” as well as original ideas from divisions including Investigation Discovery, Animal Planet and Science. Strategies vary widely among programmers, but episodes on Snapchat are typically three to six minutes long and are available for one day.\xa0A series can consist of as many as 24 episodes,\xa0often published daily or weekly.\xa0', 'Discovery Communications Chief Commercial Officer Paul Guyardo, who overseas ad sales and digital initiatives for the Silver Spring, Md.-based cable programmer,\xa0said Snapchat is an important way to reach younger consumers.\xa0Only 11% of 18- to 34-year-olds\xa0watch the company’s cable channels, he said. Discovery hasn’t announced what its first shows will be, but Guyardo said the company has a team of three to four employees\xa0devoted to developing and producing Snapchat material.\xa0', "“This really is an opportunity\xa0to perfect our ability to create short form content,” Guyardo said.\xa0“It's got to\xa0be much more snackable.\xa0It's got to\xa0be instantly engaging and something\xa0that’s going to attract the attention of a younger audience.”\xa0", 'In another recent example, Disney-ABC Television Group made a pact with Snap to make shows for the service, including a companion piece for the reality matchmaking program “The Bachelor.”\xa0', 'Other networks have gotten a head start making material for Snapchat’s vertical video portal, sometimes designing offshoots of their previously existing shows. NBC, for example, created a version of “The Voice” in which viewers submit their own video auditions for the chance to appear on the singing show. E! News has launched a pop culture wrap-up show called “The Rundown,” which chronicles events such as Sunday’s Oscars.\xa0', 'John Najarian, executive vice president of E! News, said about 75% of “The Rundown’s” audience is 13 to 24 years old, he said.', "“There is no road map,” Najarian said. “It's not just taking television content and putting it in a vertical format.\xa0There's a different feel and a different pace to it.”", 'Details about the success of these content initiatives are sparse. About 158 million people open Snapchat each day, but neither Snapchat nor its video partners disclose viewership of their shows. Snapchat said it shared nearly $58 million in ad revenue with media companies last year, but the figure doesn’t include revenue content partners earn from ads that they sell themselves. And networks declined to say how much they plan to spend on Snapchat programming.', 'Executives concede the Hollywood-Snapchat relationship is still in its experimental stages, where both sides are trying to learn what kinds of shows work. It remains to be seen when and how the movie studios will invest in\xa0Snapchat content, or whether they will continue to view the platform primarily as an advertising tool.', 'One concern studio executives have is whether their big-screen franchises can translate to the tiny screen format. There’s good reason for skepticism. Studios have long struggled to convert their expertise in making full-length movies to creating popular shows for online spaces such as YouTube and Facebook.', 'But\xa0Creatv Media’s\xa0Csathy said Hollywood players\xa0risk\xa0being left behind if they don’t figure out how to make\xa0Snapchat shows soon.\xa0', "“I\xa0think those who didn't take the plunge are kicking themselves now,” he said.", '\xa0', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

First, undercover police officers bought\xa0cocaine, PCP and meth from street dealers in southwest Los Angeles.', 'Then, investigators worked their way up the hierarchy of the Black P-Stone gang, gathering enough\xa0intelligence to prepare search or arrest warrants for alleged mid- to high-level gang leaders.', 'And in the pre-dawn hours Thursday morning, Los Angeles Police Department officers fanned out across Baldwin Village and nearby areas, arresting 15 people and seizing an array of guns, drugs and body armor,\xa0as well as more than $12,000 in cash.', 'The operation, called “No Stone Love,” began in December after an increase in shootings, robberies and burglaries, and was completed in under three months. Those arrested included 79-year-old Clyde Bailey, nicknamed “Pops,” and three men in their 60s.\xa0', 'Investigators will try to link the\xa0assault weapons, handguns, shotguns and rifles to recent\xa0homicides and shootings. They believe the Black P-Stones\xa0are\xa0responsible for a quarter of the gang-related crimes in the area.', 'The drugs seized included two kilos of rock and powder cocaine\xa0valued at $50,000, along with a pound of marijuana and three ounces of PCP.', '“We’ve made the community safer. These guns will\xa0no longer be used in other crimes,” Capt. Darnell Davenport of the LAPD’s Southwest Division\xa0said at a news conference Thursday. “The marijuana and cocaine and other drugs you see here will not be sold to community members.”', 'Those arrested Thursday morning are suspected of controlling the narcotics trade in the Baldwin Village area, which has long been Black P-Stones turf and is also known as Lower Baldwin Hills or the Jungle.', 'The suspects were arrested on gun or drug charges, but LAPD officials expect to add more serious charges for some of them.', '“Since these people will be in jail, we hope, for a long period of time, we will see a significant reduction in violent crime in that community and the sales of narcotics,” Davenport said.', 'The weapons and armor seized in the\xa0raids\xa0demonstrate\xa0a high level of sophistication and include\xa0shields capable of deflecting ammunition from high-powered firearms, LAPD officials said.', 'The undercover drug buys that launched the operation were higher-end, too — about $200 each, said Officer James Moon, who works narcotics in the Southwest Division.', 'Some\xa0high-level Black P-Stone leaders are still at large, but officials said the arrests have created gaps in the leadership structure of the gang,\xa0which has about 250 active members.', '“This has a significant impact,” Moon said. “Some of those supplying narcotics and guns are completely out of the equation.”', 'The group picked up Thursday was noteworthy for the advanced age of some members. In addition to\xa0Bailey, those arrested included Vincent Pheine, 66\xa0Michael “Money Mike” Lofton, 62 and Kenneth “Popeye” Harrison, 61.', 'Michael “Tank” Boddie, 37, was one of the leaders despite being a younger member, Moon said. Court records show that in 2006, Boddie was sentenced to four years in prison for an assault with a firearm.', 'Lt.

Rams General Manager Les Snead was at the podium first. About an hour later, new Coach Sean McVay took his turn.', 'Their news conferences, and Thursday’s smaller media confabs,  were among many tasks to be completed this week at the NFL scouting combine, most importantly interviewing and evaluating draft prospects.', 'But the combine — and for that matter the draft — are secondary priorities for a team expected to seriously delve into free agency for the first time in years.', 'The Rams, the NFL’s worst offensive team the last two seasons, have a glaring need at wide receiver and major issues along the offensive line. They also are thin at cornerback and in need of linebacker depth.', 'And they do not have a first-round draft pick, courtesy of the blockbuster trade that enabled them to choose quarterback Jared Goff first overall last year.', 'So the Rams are preparing for the start of free agency. It unofficially begins Tuesday with a 48-hour window known as the “legal tampering” period, when representatives for free agents can negotiate with teams but not sign contracts.  The first day that players can sign contracts comes two days later.', 'Teams that have put the franchise tag on players — the Rams tagged cornerback Trumaine Johnson for the second year in a row —  already can negotiate long-term contracts with them.', "“We're definitely planning to be active,” Snead said of free agency. “But you gotta wait to see how the process goes and see who goes off the board, what they get paid and do they factor into your big picture.", 'The Rams’ roster will undergo change in the next few months via free agency and the NFL draft.', 'A redesign of parts of their home uniform is already complete.', 'After two days of voting by fans, the Rams announced Thursday that the 2017 ensemble would feature a navy blue helmet with white horns and...', 'The Rams’ roster will undergo change in the next few months via free agency and the NFL draft.', 'A redesign of parts of their home uniform is already complete.', 'After two days of voting by fans, the Rams announced Thursday that the 2017 ensemble would feature a navy blue helmet with white horns and...', '“But I definitely think we need to use free agency to supplement our roster.”', 'The Rams also must make decisions about their impending free agents.', 'Receiver Kenny Britt will test the market and running back Benny Cunningham’s status is uncertain. How safety T.J. McDonald could\xa0 fit into new defensive coordinator Wade Phillips’ scheme is still to be determined.', 'Snead, who survived the firing of former coach Jeff Fisher, and McVay said they are working well together as they assess  the roster and formulate  personnel strategy.', '“We’ve been in communication every single day, constantly talking about situations, scenarios, how we evaluate our players, what we’re trying to do to find players that fit our offensive and defensive schemes,” McVay said. “And  really feel fortunate to work with him and looking forward for this partnership for a long time.”', 'Snead, 46, said he and the 31-year-old McVay are philosophically similar.', '“But like anything,” Snead said, “when you have a partner in fantasy football and you’re trying to decide who to insert in fantasy football, you may have a different running back or receiver than your  buddy.', '“But I think all of those things work together. You try to sit down and have a core philosophy.”', 'Another losing season had just ended with a disappointing loss to the Arizona Cardinals.', 'Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who played under a franchise tag in 2016, stood in the Coliseum locker room and pondered whether it might his last game with the organization that drafted him in 2012.', "“I don't...", 'Another losing season had just ended with a disappointing loss to the Arizona Cardinals.', 'Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who played under a franchise tag in 2016, stood in the Coliseum locker room and pondered whether it might his last game with the organization that drafted him in 2012.', "“I don't...", "Snead described McVay as “a ball of energy — and it starts at 4 a.m. and it's still going at 10:30 p.m.” He said he was working with McVay and the coaching staff in a collective effort to identify areas that can be addressed through free agency and the draft.", '“And those moments start early and go late,” Snead said, “and that’s where you really get that synergy.”', 'Before the Rams made McVay the youngest coach in modern NFL history, he spent three seasons as the Washington Redskins’ offensive coordinator. He oversaw a unit that in 2016 ranked third in the NFL, with an attack that featured quarterback Kirk Cousins and receivers DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, among others.', 'Jackson and Garcon are impending free-agent receivers.', 'When asked whether Jackson was the type of player who could play alongside Rams receiver Tavon Austin, McVay declined to specify, citing tampering rules.', '“We had a lot of great players there,” McVay said of the Redskins. “And when you look at the success he’s had over time, he’s a great player. But we’ll visit that at a later date if that’s what it gets to.”', 'He acknowledged that relationships with players he had coached could be advantageous.', '“Well, I think any time that you’re able to be around players in general, you’d like to think that a relationship’s formed with any former player that you’ve worked with,” he said. “And how that affects the way that we’ll move forward, that’ll be determined.”', 'Notes', 'After two days of voting by fans, the Rams announced that the 2017 home uniform ensemble would feature a navy blue helmet with white horns and a white facemask, and white pants emblazoned with a single navy blue stripe.

Not since the debut of its original Nintendo Entertainment System has the Japanese company released a home video game console with as much potential to shake up how we play as the Nintendo Switch, which is out Friday.', 'Thirty years ago, Nintendo reinvented the video game medium. Not only did the NES lead to such genre-defining interactive entertainment as "Super Mario Bros." and "The Legend of Zelda," but it also liberated games from the arcade and brought them to the American living room.', 'Where they could increasingly be played for hours, days, weeks, months. Rather than intense, cliffhanger-like action that demanded the next 25 cents, home games had pace, tempo and rudimentary stories. They were also accessible — no obscenely pricey home computer or trip to a teenage-infested arcade needed.', "The Switch takes that livability to another level. It is a home video game console that's connected to a television. But it's also a hand-held device designed for ultimate mobility. And at least one of its games barely requires the use of a screen at all.", "The Switch doesn't tell you how, or where, it should be played the Switch adapts to suit to your needs. In many ways, it’s the antidote for the the toy-like Wii U, which used a plastic, tablet-like controller and, in hindsight, misjudged our appetite for multiple screens. Selling just 13.6 million units since its launch in 2012, the Wii U has the unfortunate distinction of being the poorest-selling Nintendo console ever. ", 'The Switch, then, is the device with which Nintendo hopes to reverse its fortunes.', 'It looks far less like a child’s plaything and is arguably the first major video game console to prioritize user convenience, down to detachable controllers. When attached to the Switch, they give it the feel of a hand-held game machine apart they become two mini individual controllers. ', 'Slip the Switch into a dock connected to your television, and it acts as a traditional video game console. Disconnect it, and the Switch instantly becomes a touch-screen-enabled tablet for gaming on the go.', 'Want to play with a friend at a coffee shop? The Switch makes that possible. Want to fuel insomnia and play into the early-morning hours in your bed, or play on the couch, staring at the TV? The Switch makes all that possible too. ', 'As an idea, there is no other video game console on the market today that feels as in tune with how we live and play.', 'Imagine a Game Boy  or an iPad, but one with the power to run a deeply expansive game such as the new “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” the sort of game that previously required a PC or TV-connected console.With such a massive game made portable, the long-held norm of being tethered to a couch feels outdated. ', 'The Switch may not fit in our pockets, but it slides easily into  our mobile and tablet-obsessed age. After a week with the Switch, it’s easy to look forward to a day when it’s possible to jump from “Breath of the Wild” to, say, an email app or Netflix. ', 'And that gets to the heart as to what is currently wrong with the Switch: It needs things for the user to do. Concepts and reality are two different things. And for all its impressive tech, the Switch is currently more theory than actuality.  ', 'The console has two major hurdles: to convince hardcore gamers that the Switch can cater to their high-powered whims, and to convince casual players that the Switch is better than a cellphone or tablet. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” immediately makes a case for the former, as it re-imagines the fantasy franchise as a more sophisticated, yet never overwhelming, free-flowing adventure. ', 'But to become a must-own system, the Switch needs more games, more apps and more connectivity.', 'At launch, the only must-own title for the $299 Switch is the $60 “Breath of the Wild.” And as with any piece of new tech, there are also some hidden costs  owners will want to invest in a microSD card to boost the console’s low memory as well as potentially an USB-C cord or additional charger to facilitate gaming away from home. ', 'The cute — and freakishly weird — party game “1-2 Switch” is worth investigating despite its $50 price tag. The title proves that Nintendo’s army of developers remain as goofy as ever, and its selection of mini-games utilizes the Switch’s detachable controllers to clever but gimmicky results that emphasize movement and interaction and de-emphasize the screen. ', 'Some games are simple and straightforward. Others are downright insane, such as games that asks players to mimic milking a cow (you squeeze the controller buttons as if they’re udders and swipe down) or cradle the controller like a baby and rock it to sleep.', 'Although these little diversions may not have long-term appeal, they feel like a win, for the Switch’s versatility invites developers to get creative.

Despite his claims of ignorance, former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca was deeply involved\xa0in efforts to interfere with FBI agents as they investigated abuses in county jails, a retired\xa0sheriff’s official testified Thursday.', 'William “Tom” Carey, a former Sheriff’s Department captain who has admitted to playing a central role in the scheme to obstruct the FBI, told jurors that he personally updated the sheriff on the efforts to thwart the federal investigation and that Baca attended\xa0several crucial meetings to discuss how to handle the crisis.\xa0', 'Speaking in a sober monotone during several hours of testimony, Carey, 58, was a potentially powerful addition for government prosecutors as they try a second time to convict Baca.', 'The first attempt ended in a mistrial in December when the jury failed to reach a verdict. All but one of the 12 jurors in the earlier trial voted to acquit Baca, with several of them saying afterward that prosecutors had built\xa0a circumstantial case against the former sheriff and failed to prove he was involved.', 'Baca, 74, retired in 2014 amid the jail crisis. He is charged with\xa0obstruction of justice, conspiracy\xa0and making false statements. He faces several years in prison if convicted.', 'Putting Carey on the stand, however, comes with some risk.\xa0Baca’s attorney, Nathan Hochman, is expected\xa0to cross-examine Carey on Friday\xa0and hammer him on the plea agreement he struck with prosecutors shortly after being indicted in 2015.', 'As part of the deal, Carey agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a single count of lying during testimony he gave at an earlier trial of a deputy convicted in the obstruction case. In exchange, the government dropped obstruction and other lying charges.', 'The deal opens Carey to attacks on his credibility.', '"Once you\'ve admitted to lying on the stand, who can believe anything you say?"\xa0defense attorney Dean Steward said at the time of the plea deal. Steward represented former Undersheriff Paul Tanaka, Baca’s second-in-command, who ultimately was convicted of directing the obstruction plan.', 'Carey has not yet been sentenced.', 'Nonetheless, Assistant U.S. Atty. Brandon Fox looked to make the most of Carey. As the head of an internal department unit that investigated criminal behavior by sheriff’s employees, Carey was among a group of officials\xa0that responded in August 2011\xa0when it was discovered that FBI agents were looking into allegations of widespread abuses by deputies against inmates in county jails.', 'Baca was present when the group met shortly after learning of the FBI inquiry. At the meeting, he ordered Carey’s group to investigate how the FBI had smuggled a\xa0cellphone to an inmate working as an informant. Baca also ordered\xa0that the informant be kept safe.\xa0', 'Under Fox’s questioning, Carey\xa0told jurors that Baca was aware his subordinates were carrying out a plan to hide the informant from FBI agents by registering him under fake names in the jail computer system and moving him to a holding cell in a distant station.', 'Baca was also present for a meeting with Tanaka, Carey and another sheriff’s official in Tanaka’s office,\xa0where\xa0it was decided that two of Carey’s investigators would confront the lead FBI agent in the case at her home.', 'While the home visit was nominally an attempt to question the agent about the smuggled phone, its real purpose was to send a message of defiance to the FBI and intimidate the agent by threatening her with arrest, Carey said.', '“He was OK with it,” Carey testified of Baca.\xa0“He didn’t tell us not to do it. His advice to us was just not to put handcuffs on her.”', 'In a rare show of some emotion, Carey’s voice raised slightly when Fox played a clip of an interview Baca gave to federal investigators in 2013, in which he claimed not to know anything about the plan to approach the agent until after it occurred.', '“Absolutely, he was aware,” Carey said.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Shortly after Jeff Sessions swore his oath as attorney general, former staffers gathered in the Oval Office alongside him and President Trump for a photo. Missing, one noticed, was Stephen Miller, who’d left Sessions’ Senate office to join Trump’s campaign and is now the president’s chief policy advisor.', 'Trump enthusiastically summoned Miller to join them, saying that without this aide who’d worked at Sessions’ side for years, he wouldn’t have been elected president.', 'That a former aide is now in a powerful West Wing position demonstrates how Sessions has so stocked Trump’s administration with allies and loyalists that his influence is unlikely to be diminished, even as he finds himself under fire for failing to disclose meetings last year with a Russian official. Sessions said Thursday that he would recuse himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election.', 'Sessions’ swearing-in marked the culmination of an unlikely partnership between Trump, the brash and burly New York businessman, and Sessions, an elfin Southerner, that brought each from the fringes of the Republican Party to the center of national power.', 'And though Sessions “doesn’t approach you as someone who’s going to deliver a knockout punch,” he and Trump share a commitment to advancing their agenda of economic populism and tough immigration enforcement, said David Horowitz, a conservative author and head of the Los Angeles-based Freedom Center, who has grown close to Miller and Sessions.', '“The Republican modus operandi was to get out of the way when you were attacked,” he said. “We’ve reached a turning point in which people are fed up with it and are tired of it.”', 'Early in the campaign, Sessions saw in Trump a willingness to unapologetically express hard-line views on immigration, as Sessions himself had for years, and the potential for Trump’s charisma and message to win him the presidency. He endorsed Trump before anyone else in the Senate, amid the heat of the primary season in early 2016, giving Trump the credibility that came from a senator’s backing. It came just before the so-called “SEC Primary” of mostly Southern states in which Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was thought to have the edge among Republicans.', 'Sessions also brought to the relationship deep knowledge of the inner workings of Washington and Congress, as well as a roster of staff who understood the machinery of the Justice Department and immigration agencies well enough to bend the bureaucracy to their will.', 'In addition to Miller, whom Trump hired in January of last year, Sessions’ former chief of staff, Rick Dearborn, is running the White House’s legislative outreach to Capitol Hill. The Sessions orbit also extends into federal agencies former staffer Gene Hamilton is crafting the plans for implementing Trump’s immigration orders at the Department of Homeland Security.', 'Though the two men joined forces only a year ago, Sessions and Trump first met more than a decade earlier, in 2005. Then, it was the Alabama senator who needed Trump’s expertise.', 'The price tag for a planned renovation of the United Nations headquarters, estimated at $1.2 billion, seemed well beyond what U.S. taxpayers should be asked to guarantee, in Sessions’ view. And in researching the issue, he discovered that the city’s most prominent real estate developer had himself cast doubt on the sky-high figure. Sessions invited Trump to join him in testifying before a Senate subcommittee investigating the issue.', '“Mr. Trump built the brand-new, top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art, 90-story Trump World Tower almost across the street for $350 million,” Sessions said, injecting a bit of Trump-esque hyperbole into the proceeding. “… How could this renovation cost $1.2 billion?”', 'Trump followed soon after and delivered what Sessions later called a “tutorial” over the nuts and bolts of New York real estate and construction, a perspective that led him to conclude the project could be done for just over half the price.', "We're tracking President Trump's first 100 days in office. Follow along with us.", "We're tracking President Trump's first 100 days in office. Follow along with us.", 'Trump, who was gaining greater prominence beyond New York by then for his new and successful prime-time reality show, “The Apprentice,” said he had raised his concerns directly with the U.N.’s leadership, and was pleased to have been summoned to meet with then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan.', '“I felt like a head of state,” Trump said.', 'But Trump said he recognized he had been invited by Annan mainly for a photo op, and his offers for experienced counsel went unheeded.', 'It would be 2013 that marked a turning point for Trump and Sessions. After President Obama’s reelection, the Republican National Committee commissioned a review of the campaign that recommended, among other things, that the party’s path back to the White House depended on more moderate approaches to policy — first and foremost, immigration.', 'Leading Republicans partnered with Democrats in the Senate that year on a comprehensive reform bill that spelled out conditions for a 10-year path to legal status for undocumented immigrants while also enhancing border security. But as it gained momentum on both sides of the aisle, Sessions emerged as its chief critic.', 'By year’s end, no other lawmaker would log as much time speaking on the Senate floor as Sessions. At the same time, Trump, discreetly testing a presidential run, was seizing on the issue in new forums of his own. In one interview that summer with Breitbart News — an emerging force for opponents to the bill and the website whose executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, would become chief White House strategist — Trump said that supporting the proposal was a “death wish” for Republicans.', '“A country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure,” he tweeted as the legislation was nearing the finish line. “Secure our borders!”', 'But politics still wasn’t his primary focus. The next night Trump posted this: “The Miss Universe Pageant will be broadcast live from MOSCOW, RUSSIA on November 9th. A big deal that will bring our countries together!”', "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", 'Sen.

Here's why the state is struggling financially.", 'The financial woes of Kansas, which is facing a colossal budget shortfall, took another odd twist this week, and an already messy situation got even messier.', 'State government expenses are estimated to outpace income by about $1.1 billion through June 2019. So how to balance the budget? The answer has proved elusive, and the debate over what to do has embroiled the governor, lawmakers and, on Thursday, the state Supreme Court.', 'Depending on the point of view, what’s happening in Kansas reflects disciplined government spending or a foolhardy bet that tax cuts would boost the economy. Here are key things to know about the budget crisis that’s being watched by liberals and conservatives from across the country.', 'What happened Thursday in the Kansas Supreme Court?', 'The state’s high court ruled that Kansas schools are not adequately funded by the Legislature.\xa0', 'Was it expected?\xa0', 'Definitely. The Supreme Court already ruled last year that there was a grave disparity in state funds received by rich districts and poor districts.\xa0', 'A key issue concerns language. Kansas operates its education budget under a court ruling dictating that funding among all its schools must be\xa0adequate\xa0(they must be given enough money to operate) and\xa0equitable\xa0(it must be shared fairly).\xa0', 'In 2016, a majority of the high court found that Kansas school funding was inequitable, setting off a frenzied period of uncertainty in the state capital, Topeka, where lawmakers were given a June 30, 2016, deadline to fix the formula or face the shutdown of all Kansas public schools.\xa0', 'Sounds like a standoff. Was it?', 'Oh yeah. And the legislators blinked, rearranging the budget to add $38 million to schools.', 'But then lawmakers who opposed the court’s ruling fought back by dragging the justices who composed the majority into expensive retention races in November.', 'All the justices won, kept their seats and ruled against the school funding formula again Thursday.\xa0', 'Back up, how did we get here?\xa0', 'There are hundreds of bar graphs and pie charts and, someday, probably cartoons to illustrate this, but the very quick version is: Gov. Sam Brownback proposed dramatic cuts to personal income tax receipts in 2012, a position consistent with the tea party movement that aimed to take spending out of government hands.', 'In February 2015, three years into the supply-side economics experiment that would upend a once steady Midwestern economy, a hole appeared in Kansas’ finances.', 'To fill it, Gov. Sam Brownback took $45 million in public education funding. By April of this year, with the hole at $290 million, Brownback...', 'In February 2015, three years into the supply-side economics experiment that would upend a once steady Midwestern economy, a hole appeared in Kansas’ finances.', 'To fill it, Gov. Sam Brownback took $45 million in public education funding. By April of this year, with the hole at $290 million, Brownback...', 'The Legislature approved the tax cuts. The strategy has faded somewhat nationally but lives on as the governing philosophy in Kansas, even though the cuts did not spur economic growth as their proponents predicted. Result: the gaping holes in the state budget.', 'What are the schools like now?\xa0', "In rich areas like the Kansas City suburbs, they're fine. In poor areas, not so good. That's what the Kansas Supreme Court said in its ruling Thursday:", '"Not only is the State failing to provide approximately one-fourth of all its public school K-12 students with the basic skills of both reading and math, but that it is also leaving behind significant groups of harder-to-educate students."\xa0', 'Is it a failing of individual districts, or is the court criticizing the whole school funding formula?', 'The court is saying that Brownback\'s entire block grant funding system will not work for schools. A block grant "is only minimally responsive to financially important changing conditions such as increased enrollment."\xa0', 'What happens now?\xa0', 'Lawmakers have\xa0until June 30\xa0to come up with a new school finance formula, which is expected to cost the state $500 million to $1 billion on top of its $6-billion education budget.', 'School funding advocates have pushed legislators to complete a new funding formula much sooner. Legislators opposed to the change to the school funding formula wondered aloud Thursday where the money would come from.\xa0', 'What about those legislators? If there was no impetus to change things after 2014, when the state Supreme Court said disparities in school funding violated the state constitution, why would they budge now?\xa0', 'A lot has changed since 2014 —\xa0primarily, elections.', 'More than 20 allies of Brownback lost their seats in November’s election. Democrats and moderate conservatives made education a central issue of their campaigns. Those Brownback allies who did survive mostly skirted the issue of school funding in their campaigns. \xa0', "If lawmakers can't cut from the schools, where will they cut?\xa0", "Well, that's going to be the next tough conversation in what is sure to be a series of tough conversations among GOP lawmakers looking to fix budget deficits in the next 30 months. That's about the time it will take for the state’s budge deficit to hit $1.1 billion. In the meantime, the state hopes for more revenue from an increased sales tax.", "And what about Brownback's budget cuts overall — what effects are they having?\xa0", "So far, not good. Legislators are desperately trying to repeal Brownback's personal income tax cuts and exemptions for 330,000 farmers and business owners, but they can't quite get the requisite support.\xa0", "Just last week, Brownback\xa0vetoed a bill that would have ended his income tax cut, and when legislators tried to override his veto, Brownback's allies squeaked out a win.\xa0", 'It was close, though. The House voted 85 to 40 to override, one more vote than lawmakers needed. The Senate rejected the veto override 24 to 16, three votes shy of an override. \xa0', 'Though the override failed, it’s notable that it came close to passing in a Legislature controlled by Republicans.', 'Is that ominous for Brownback?', 'Good question.\xa0', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield on Thursday morning showed just how sticky\xa0the investigation into\xa0Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 election has become for some Republicans.', '“I think the trust of the American people,\xa0you recuse yourself in these situations, yes,” McCarthy said on left-leaning MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” when asked if Atty. Gen. Jeff\xa0Sessions should recuse himself from investigations into the election allegations. The evening before, a Washington Post story showed\xa0he did not disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador when asked about them during his Senate confirmation hearing.', 'In the next hour, the Republican McCarthy was on right-leaning “Fox &amp Friends,” saying he never called on Sessions to relinquish control.\xa0McCarthy said the attorney general should just clarify what happened.', '“I’m not calling on him to recuse himself …. It’s amazing how people spin things so quickly,” McCarthy said. “It’s amazing how this story comes out right after a great speech by this president, the timing. In his role as senator, he’s going to meet with a lot of ambassadors. That’s his job.”', 'By day’s end, Sessions had indeed recused himself from investigations into the presidential election won by his boss, Republican President Trump. But California’s 14 Congressional Republicans, half of whom are facing potentially tight battles to keep their seats in 2018,\xa0remained\xa0split — or noticeably silent — on what to do about Sessions.', 'California’s two Democratic senators and dozens of the state’s 38 Democratic House members quickly called on Sessions to recuse himself from Justice Department investigations into Russia’s election meddling, with many going further and saying he needs to resign.\xa0Even centrist Democrats like San Diego’s Rep. Scott Peters said Sessions should resign.', 'Just four of California’s Republican House members called for Sessions to recuse himself on Thursday.', 'A week ago, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of Vista suggested Sessions should recuse himself, and added a special prosecutor could be necessary, during an appearance on HBO’s “Real Time With Bill Maher.” On Thursday, he made sure everyone knew he was ahead of the pack — at least within the GOP.', '“The news breaking overnight reaffirms what I called for in an interview last Friday, that we need an independent review by a credible third party and that Attorney General Sessions should recuse himself from any investigation into Russia,” Issa said in a statement. “We need a clear-eyed view of what the Russians actually did so that all Americans can have faith in our institutions.”', 'Later Thursday, Republican Reps. Ed\xa0Royce of Fullerton, Mimi Walters of Irvine and Steve Knight of Santa Clarita joined Issa, but only in his call for Sessions to recuse himself.', 'The four\xa0are among the seven Republican-held California districts national Democrats plan to target in 2018. Voters in each of the districts picked Hillary Clinton for president, and Issa won his ninth term with just 1,600 more votes than his challenger. Others, like McCarthy, are in districts that solidly voted for Trump, but have been encountering big protests at their town halls and offices, many focused on Trump and the GOP’s plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\xa0', 'Some of them are facing the\xa0most heated confrontations in their districts in years, and urging Sessions to recuse himself may be the first steps they’re taking to\xa0distance\xa0themselves from a president\xa0who is very unpopular in California.', 'New revelations about Atty.

Tom McClintock of Elk Grove, David Valadao of Hanford, Jeff Denham of Turlock and Paul Cook of Yucca Valley,\xa0did not respond to requests for their thoughts on Sessions.', 'Valadao and Denham are on Democrats’ target list in 2018. Though Clinton won their districts, they’ve consistently won reelection and may not be too concerned. McClintock and Cook represent solidly red seats, although Cook faced a challenge from tea party favorite Tim Donnelly, a former state assemblyman, in the primary.', 'Another target for Democrats\xa0is\xa0Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who represents a coastal Orange County district that\xa0went for Clinton. But he’s also well established in his district,\xa0a well-known Russia dove\xa0and is unimpressed by the Sessions kerfuffle.', '“Big deal! Sessions is one of the most honorable figures on the Washington political scene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with him, as a senator or a campaign adviser, to have met briefly with the Russian ambassador to understand issues that might confront the next administration,” he said in a statement, explaining that Sessions might not have understood the questions asked about his Russia contacts during the confirmation hearing.', 'Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), who chairs the House intelligence committee,\xa0would not say during a news conference Thursday morning if he thought Sessions should relinquish control over an investigation.\xa0Nunes was a member of Trump’s transition team and, with a solidly Republican district, has for months been tempering expectations about the investigation into Russia’s role in the election.', '“I have no idea, because we have no idea what — what he did or didn’t do. So I think it’s up to the attorney general… to talk to the senators if there’s some disagreement there,” Nunes told reporters.', 'Republican Duncan Hunter of Alpine, who was rumored as a potential cabinet candidate and is also from a safe Republican district, took the strongest stance in defense of Sessions: He accused the Democrats of being on a political “witch hunt” against Trump and his administration, saying that Sessions, who was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee before he became attorney general, had every right to meet with the Russian ambassador.', 'Hunter suspects Sessions’ failure to disclose the meeting during his confirmation hearing was either an “unconscious mistake” or a misunderstanding. The attorney general likely interpreted the question to be about whether he met with the Russian ambassador on behalf of the Trump campaign, Hunter said.', '“I don’t think he needs to recuse himself, but if he decides to just to calm everyone fears, that’s fine too,” Hunter said in a telephone interview. ', 'Even with Sessions’ recusal, California’s vulnerable Republicans are likely to continue to feel pressure on the Russia investigation.', 'Rep. Adam Schiff of Burbank, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, appeared at the news conference midday Thursday with Nunes and had a decidedly different take than\xa0his fellow committee leader, saying for the first time that a special prosecutor should be appointed. That’s\xa0a step beyond simple recusal, which still allows Sessions’ deputy\xa0to be involved in the case. Later in the day, Schiff called on Sessions to resign.', '“After reviewing Attorney General Session’s testimony during his confirmation hearing and his statements this afternoon, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the Attorney General should step down,” Schiff said in a statement. “As a Senator, Mr. Sessions demanded complete and truthful testimony by those appearing before him for confirmation, and I do not believe he met his own rigorous standard.”', 'With that, Schiff joined a chorus of other Democratic voices — including\xa0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Sen. Kamala Harris — who\xa0are still\xa0calling for the attorney general to step down.', "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", 'Sen.

After the NFL’s salary cap for the 2017 season was  set at $167 million, anyone interested in finding out how much room the Chargers have\xa0  to sign free agents would’ve needed to move their eyes from north to south\xa0to find Los Angeles’ new team near the bottom of the spending list. ', 'With roughly only $6 million in current wiggle room, the Chargers would barely be able to afford Orange County real estate, nevertheless top free agents to put in their Costa Mesa digs when the team moves later this summer.', 'But General Manager Tom Telesco made sure to remind everyone during his media session at the NFL scouting combine his team wasn’t in great cap peril. In fact, they’ve already landed one of their top targets.', 'The team put the franchise tag on  edge rusher Melvin Ingram earlier in the week, and  Telesco said Thursday he hopes to soon have Ingram  signed to a long-term contract. ', '“We know Melvin was a priority with us this off-season. Him as a player, the position he plays, what he’s done for us — pass rushers are very important in this league,” Telesco said. “If we didn’t have Melvin Ingram, we’d have a pretty big hole as a pass rusher. It was important to get him back with us.”', 'Ingram’s franchise tag as a linebacker will cost the team $14.5 million, but a new, long-term deal could be structured to lessen its  impact on the cap.  The team also could  release veterans under contract — wideout Stevie Johnson is considered an option — as a way to clear  more space.\xa0', 'The Chargers have placed the nonexclusive franchise tag on their top free agent, edge-rushing linebacker Melvin Ingram, the club announced Monday.', 'Ingram, provided he signs the tender, will make north of $15 million next year — money that’ll be fully guaranteed.

', '“He’s quick  good hands out of the backfield,” Lynn, a long-time running backs coach, said. “I had Danny in New York so I know him very well. He’s a good changeup from  Melvin [Gordon]. Melvin is more of that bigger, taller, physical runner. And Danny can bring that finesse and that quickness and that perimeter run game.”', 'Last year, the team ranked No. 26 in rushing offense.', 'The struggles running the ball plus the need to protect quarterback Philip Rivers has “offensive linemen” near the top of the Chargers’ wish list while they evaluate prospects.

I understand he’s dealing with the law right now, and we’re going to let that process work out,” Lynn said. “I don’t want to make any judgments on him right now.”', 'Telesco also said the team would be patient.', '“These are decisions you need to work on,” he said. “We’re still gathering a lot of information on that, forming a determination of what we do.”', 'Even if Dunlap is with the Chargers, the team’s offensive line is in need of an upgrade.', '“Right now, we’re counting on everybody who is under contract on the offensive line. Make no mistake about it I think we can play better on the offensive line,” Lynn said. “And, we will. I think there are some things we can do differently as a coaching staff that’s going to help those guys, and we’re looking to upgrade the position if possible.”', 'Trouble is, it might be difficult for the Chargers to use their first-round pick, the seventh overall, to address the need without overreaching.', '“I’d say offensive line in general this year is probably not as strong as other years,” Telesco said. “…For us, it’s all relative to what you’re looking for and what your traits are at certain positions, whether tackle, guard or center. I know we’ve got some guys that we like. I haven’t really compared it to last year’s numbers yet, but in general, I would say, yeah, it’s probably not as strong as other years.”', 'The large glass windows inside the American Express Club at StubHub Center offered a picturesque pitch that the Los Angeles Chargers will turn into their home field.', 'Across the room is a private bar, cold beer on tap.

But he’s on track, where he should be, which is good news,” Telesco said. …', 'Telesco was asked about Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly being excluded from the combine, with the league excluding Kelly and Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon from the event after high-profile legal problems.', '“It’s my 23rd combine. I never really felt the combine was a reward for a college player’s career,” he said. “The combine to me was always, this is an evaluation event for us to see everybody that we think is an NFL prospect, and get our work done on them. We’ll get our work done one way or another.”

The Dream Center Foundation, a philanthropic foundation in Los Angeles, is buying the vast majority of career colleges owned by Education Management Corp. — including 31 Art Institute campuses, Argosy University and South University — in a deal announced Friday that underscores the instability of the for-profit education industry.', 'Education Management, or EDMC, was once one of the largest for-profit college chains in the country, with more than 150,000 students studying such fields as culinary arts, health sciences and education at 106 locations in 32 states and Canada. Tepid demand in recent years sank enrollment to 65,000 as of October. By then, the company had announced the closure of 23 of its 26 Brown Mackie College campuses and 19 of its 52 Art Institute locations.', '"We feel the Art Institutes have a good history, despite the last few years, and we\'ll be able to turn that back around," said Randall Barton, managing director of the Dream Center Foundation.', "The foundation funds programs through the Dream Center Los Angeles that provide job training and free preparation classes for the California high school equivalency exam, as well as a host of services for the homeless, veterans and impoverished children. Barton said acquiring EDMC aligns with the foundation's desire to use education as a means of transforming lives.", 'EDMC will retain ownership of 43 Brown Mackie and Art Institute locations where it has stopped enrolling new students and is in the process of "teaching out" those left on campus. The company previously sold three Brown Mackie locations and one Art Institute campus in Vancouver, Canada. In the latest deal, the parties gave conflicting accounts of the sale price, pegging it somewhere in the ballpark of $60 million.', 'Mark McEachen, president and chief executive of EDMC, said that the company entertained other suitors but that many wanted to cut costs in a way that would have undermined the classroom experience. The company, he said, was won over by the mission of the Dream Center.', '"The passion and commitment that these folks have ... only means reinvestment in the classroom, which only means a more motivated faculty and staff, which ultimately leads to what we want — a good student experience," he said.', 'The for-profit college boom has gone bust.', 'Closures\xa0of high-profile schools such as\xa0ITT Technical Institute have left thousands of students in limbo while raising questions about the future of an industry that provides training for vocational, technical and other mid-level skilled\xa0jobs.', 'For-profit...', 'The for-profit college boom has gone bust.', 'Closures\xa0of high-profile schools such as\xa0ITT Technical Institute have left thousands of students in limbo while raising questions about the future of an industry that provides training for vocational, technical and other mid-level skilled\xa0jobs.', 'For-profit...', 'In hindsight, McEachen said, revamping programs might have helped stave off some of the enrollment decline. The schools the company chose to close, he said, were losing money for years and were never going to be profitable again as enrollment continued to slide.', 'McEachen said that he managed to stabilize EDMC after shrinking its footprint, but that selling the campuses to a nonprofit foundation that could raise money for scholarships and to improve operations was in the best interests of the students.', 'The new owner has tapped Brent Richardson, the former chairman of Grand Canyon Education, as chief executive of Dream Center Education Holdings, which will manage university operations. Richardson led the transformation of Grand Canyon University into a for-profit school with a robust online presence, but he resigned from his post in January, two years after shareholders made an unsuccessful bid to oust him for not attending enough board meetings.', 'Now Richardson is to lead the transformation of the three EDMC schools into nonprofit universities, a conversion that is sure to draw scrutiny from higher education experts who have decried such moves as end runs around regulations aimed at for-profit colleges.', 'Nonprofit universities are not subject to what\'s known as the 90/10 rule, which bars for-profit colleges from getting more than 90% of their operating revenue from federal student aid. And few nonprofits have to adhere to rules that measure whether graduates of career-training programs obtain "gainful employment" to repay student loans.', 'For-profit conversions have been met with skepticism by the Education Department, which along with the  Internal Revenue Service decides whether to approve such changes. In August, the department denied a request from the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, a Utah-based chain of career colleges, accusing the company of trying to skirt regulations.', 'The Center for Excellence applied for nonprofit status shortly after purchasing Stevens-Henager College and College America from Carl Barney for $636 million in 2012. Education officials said they were uneasy with Barney retaining primary control of the colleges and collecting rent on some of the campuses when becoming a nonprofit school is supposed to mean placing control in the hands of trustees who operate with no financial benefit.', '"This transaction is nothing like that transaction," Barton, who will serve as executive chairman of Dream Center Education, said of the EDMC deal. "There was a contractual change and a legal change, but it was more form over substance. This is a total change. None of the executives, none of the owners, none of the creditors will have any involvement after we acquire."', "What's more, Barton said, none of the three universities are close to getting 90% of their operating revenue from federal student aid funding. He said the new company will review the course offerings at all three schools and consider adding academic programs with a technology focus at the Art Institutes.", 'Dream Center Education plans to invest a percentage of revenue from the schools in scholarships for students and charitable programs administered by the foundation. The principal financing for the deal is being provided by an affiliate of the investment firm Najafi Companies, with additional funding from the Richardson Family Trust.', 'The sale, which is anticipated to close this summer, needs approval from the Education Department and college accreditors. McEachen said all the people employed at the universities being sold to the foundation will retain their jobs.', 'This is not the first time that EDMC has revamped its business. The company went private in 2006 and used new capital to grow its online operations. The move, however, was not enough to shield the school from a downturn in business, so it reverted to a publicly traded firm in 2009.', 'Five years later, the company delisted its stock from Nasdaq and stopped filing financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying the costs of being publicly traded outweighed the benefits.', 'Things took a turn for the worse the following year, when EDMC reached a $95-million settlement with the Justice Department and several state attorneys general. The deal resolved allegations that the company paid employees based on student enrollment in violation of a federal ban on incentive compensation at schools in the federal financial aid programs. McEachen said the settlement had a negative impact on enrollment.', '"There is some reputational damage that we\'ll have to work through, and that was part of the purchase price, quite frankly," Barton said.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Chimezie Metu, USC’s 6-foot-11, spidery-limbed shot blocker, was not embarrassed to report after Friday’s practice that he had been the victim — on not one, but two occasions — of a brutal rejection. On dunks, no less. By a guard.', '"There were no fouls,” said Metu said. “He just — he blindsided me. I didn\'t see him coming. The first time, I had no idea where he was at. The second time I saw him coming, I just tried to shoot it anyway. And he got it.”', 'During games, Metu is almost always the blocker, not the blockee, but he just shrugged.', '“It happens to everybody,” he said.', "“You can't really say nothing,” the perpetrator, shooting guard Elijah Stewart, explained. “They were all clean.”", 'A key to playing against USC’s defense is swallowing a bit of pride. There will be blocks. Sometimes they will be humiliating. It is best to just move on.', 'True to Coach Andy Enfield’s reputation for high-flying offenses, USC has also created its share of dunks — Metu alone has out-dunked the combined total of USC’s opponents, according to statistics compiled by USC.', 'But USC’s most defining stylistic feature has become not the slam but the rejection. Of all the major statistical categories, USC cracks the top-10 nationally in one: blocks. USC (22-8, 9-8 in the Pac-12) has 166 on the season, an average of 5.5 a game. The Trojans, who host Washington (9-20, 2-15) on Saturday in the final regular-season game, set a school record with 182 blocks last season.', 'If Enfield’s system is still known best as “Dunk City,” the Trojans have at least now founded a Swat Suburb.', "“There's a big difference between when we win a Pac-12 game and when we don't between our activity: deflections, steals, blocks,” Enfield said.", 'Metu leads the team in the category at 46, and he is usually responsible for the most psychologically damaging blocks. On Wednesday, Metu managed, in one motion, to reject an attempt by Washington State’s Josh Hawkinson while also palming the ball, as if he were swinging a vacuum hose instead of hands.', '"I was going to swat it, and he shot it right into my palm. So I just snatched it,” Metu said.', 'USC’s best per-minute shot blocker has actually been 7-footer Nick Rakocevic, who averages almost twice as many blocks per minute than Metu.', 'But the Trojans have been elite shot-blockers because of the contributions of their guards. Stewart, who has 36 blocks, ranks fifth in the nation among guards. De’Anthony Melton has 33, despite only starting slightly more than half the season.', 'Dunks and blocks usually require complementary skills. Enfield said he targets recruits with raw athletic ability, betting that the player can develop in his system. It is easier to develop a jump shooter than a shot-blocker.', "“It's either you have it or you don't,” Metu said.", 'Still, there are ways to improve. Given the prerequisite athleticism, timing is the most important skill, Metu said. As a freshman, Metu abandoned his man too early, leading to easy passes or put-backs. He has now learned patience and the art of jumping second: leaving his feet, he learned, is a good way to pick up a foul. Some shooters, Metu said, try to use their eyes to deceive, and Metu tries to remember which ones look away when they are really about to shoot.', 'As a guard Stewart uses different cues. The majority of his blocks come on the perimeter — a rarity. So he studies a shooter’s tendencies, much the way a cornerback learns to read a quarterback’s motion to jump a route.', '"We watch so much film you can tell when someone\'s going to shoot or what their favorite move into a jump shot is,” Stewart said.', 'He said he learned right-handers usually like to pull up after a left-handed dribble, for instance.', 'Stewart thinks his block totals would be higher if not for Melton, a strong help defender, who can get in the way of Stewart’s leaps.', '"We argue about that all the time," Stewart said.', 'Not surprisingly, Metu, Stewart and Melton are USC’s three most prolific dunkers, too. Metu said that his 66 slams and ally-oops were what he envisioned when he first watched Enfield coach at Florida Gulf Coast.', 'But the rejections?', '"I had no idea,” Metu said. “They don\'t show the highlights of the blocks, they just show the highlights of throwing lobs and jumping and all that stuff. But when you get older as a player, you kind of realize you have to defend in order to get that."', 'Etc.', 'USC hasn’t reached double-digit conference wins (or a winning conference record) since 2011. … USC will honor forwards Samer Dhillon and Charles Buggs and manager Silas Gaines on senior day Saturday.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a major presence in Tuesday’s elections, has strong opinions about local schools and options for helping the homeless.', 'On the homeless front, he said he reluctantly sees more tents and more sleeping bags as the most viable solution. Riordan has endorsed Measure S, which would strictly limit development in Los Angeles for two years. The effect of Measure S on efforts to house the homeless is being debated across the city.', 'As for education, he said the L.A. school system continues to fail students. He’s putting his money on charters and board members who support them, although he’d also like to help teachers find affordable housing.', 'Riordan has donated $1 million to a political action committee whose sole purpose is to defeat school board President Steve Zimmer, part of a strategy to get a board majority allied with supporters of charter schools. He also gave $1 million to a charter advocacy group. It’s funneling money into the three contests for L.A. school board seats, including Zimmer’s District 4, which includes the Westside and part of the west San Fernando Valley.', 'Zimmer is seeking a third term and had won Riordan’s endorsement in the past, but the wealthy businessman said he’s dissatisfied with Zimmer’s follow-through. It’s time for an upgrade and to shake things up in the district, Riordan said.', 'Riordan sits on the board of local charter schools and has been involved in education philanthropy for decades.', '“The bureaucracy is far worse at the schools than at the charter schools,” he said. “The main thing is having transparency of what’s right and what’s wrong. The number of the people in the bureaucracy — what do they accomplish for the schools?”', 'As an example, he said he recently tried to jump-start projects that would provide affordable housing for teachers, but L.A. Unified’s response was sluggish.', '“I don’t include the teachers in the word bureaucracy. But you do come down to the teachers,” he said. “How about transparency in how many teachers are in the rubber room?”', 'Riordan was referring to the number of teachers on paid suspension because they are under investigation. That number ballooned to 322 in the wake of a high-profile arrest in 2012. The current number is 109 in a workforce of 25,124 instructors, according to the district. L.A. Unified attributes the reduction to the hiring of an investigation team and a better working relationship with the teachers union.', 'The former mayor said that’s not enough progress: “If you were on the school board, wouldn’t you figure out how to get rid of that 100 no matter how much you had to pay them or whatever?”', 'Riordan said that when he served as mayor, from 1993 to 2001, he used to identify people who needed to be removed from city employment, only to be told that it would take too long or never happen at all.', '“I would tell people, ‘You have two months to get it done,’ and they always found a way,” Riordan said. “We need to get rid of these people and we want to bring on these good teachers.”', 'He said the school board also should make it easier for charters to get access to classroom space on district campuses.', '“They should get honest and share some of that space, and they can charge for it, as far as I know,” Riordan said. “They can share everything. They shouldn’t be against each other. They should be for each other because it’s all for the children.”', 'In the Zimmer race, Riordan is endorsing Nick Melvoin, the son of friend, Brentwood neighbor and Hollywood producer Jeff Melvoin. In his 2014 autobiography, Riordan recounts hearing about challenges the younger Melvoin faced during a two-year stint as a teacher in Watts, including being laid off — along with other young teachers without seniority — and later hired back.', 'The tale inspired Riordan to help launch a lawsuit, in which Melvoin participated, to limit the impact of seniority-based layoffs at an individual school. It eventually led to a settlement.', 'Riordan said he also likes the other charter-endorsed candidate in District 4, Allison Holdorff Polhill. But he subtracts a few points because the charter she helped run, Palisades Charter High School, has a union contract. Riordan said the contract makes it too difficult to fire teachers, although he said the school appears to be performing better than L.A. Unified-run campuses.', 'On the city front, Riordan backs Measure S despite the claims of critics that its provisions would limit, if not suspend, construction of housing for the homeless. The measure imposes a two-year moratorium on all real estate projects that require a General Plan amendment, zone change or increase in allowable height. Most homeless advocates and city officials oppose Measure S.', 'In a dig at development practices under current Mayor Eric Garcetti, Riordan said it hasn’t helped that “Garcetti’s buddies have bought up all the properties.”', '“The city says it has all this extra land for the homeless and I don’t believe them,” Riordan said. Even parking lots in skid row command prices that are “astronomical,” he said.', 'Riordan said that his charitable foundation has provided tents and sleeping bags to the homeless, and that approach is probably the most pragmatic solution within reach.', 'The city, he said, also should invest in centers where the homeless can shower, receive medication and receive other services.', '“But as far as actually finding buildings they can live in, which our beloved mayor talks about, that is not realistic,” he said.', 'Riordan also opposes homeless encampments, whether they are officially set up or informally established by the homeless, because they become a magnet for drug dealing and other crimes.', 'Instead, “let them find their own places on the streets,” he said. “It’s an incredible problem.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

President Trump, in his recent address to Congress, echoed a long-running campaign theme, urging lawmakers to introduce a “school choice” initiative that would allow “disadvantaged youth” to attend a “public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school.”', 'One of Trump’s guests Tuesday night in the House chamber gallery was Denisha Merriweather, who, after twice failing third grade, the president pointed out, graduated from a Florida private school "with the help of a tax credit scholarship program" and is now finishing a master’s degree.', 'Trump highlighted vouchers again Friday during his first official school visit as president — to a Catholic school that is run out of the Diocese of Orlando, Fla.', 'If Merriweather’s appearance and Trump’s Orlando visit are any indication, Trump’s model for how to spread school choice could be Florida’s program. That state uses a tax credit scholarship program to funnel public dollars to private schools.', 'At St. Andrew Catholic School in Orlando, Trump mentioned the possibility of tax credit scholarships as a way forward, said Ron Matus. Matus directs policy and public affairs for Step Up for Students, the organization that manages Florida’s scholarship donations.', 'Here’s a primer on private school choice in Florida, and how it might translate nationally — and affect even voucher-averse states such as California.', 'What are school vouchers?', 'Vouchers provide public money to families so that children can attend private schools, including religious schools.', 'Why are they so controversial?', 'Opponents, including many Democrats, believe they blur or even violate the separation of church and state, and these critics worry about the use of public money without adequate regulation.', 'What are tax credit scholarships, and how are they different from vouchers?', 'There are two different models of tax credit programs to pay for tuition.', 'One allows parents to write off a certain amount of income tax and apply that money toward private school tuition. The deduction tends to be far smaller than the cost of tuition, so some argue that it most benefits people who already have the means to send their kids to such schools.', 'The other model — which Trump has praised — is more indirect. Businesses get tax breaks by donating money to nonprofit organizations. Those organizations then give students scholarships to private or parochial schools. ', 'How does the Florida tax credit scholarship work?', 'Companies get dollar-for-dollar tax credits for their contributions to nonprofit scholarship organizations. Depending on the type of tax, they can get credit for between 50% and 100% of their tax liabilities through the program.', 'Parents apply for scholarships by submitting pay stubs, tax returns and other financial documents. If eligible, they can get up to $5,886 per student and apply that money toward tuition at a set list of private K-12 schools. The average cost of private school in Florida this year is $7,864.', 'Who is eligible for a Florida tax credit scholarship?', 'The program is focused on low-income families. Initially, families making up to 185% of the federal poverty line, or about $45,000 for a family of four, were eligible for new scholarships, and they could renew if they were making up to 200% of the federal poverty line, Matus said.', 'Starting this school year, higher-income families making up to 260% of the poverty line, or $64,000 for a family of four, were eligible for smaller scholarship amounts. In all, about 98,000 students use the scholarships.', 'What kind of schools get the money?', 'Eighty-five percent of Florida schools that accept the scholarship are religious schools, according to David Figlio, an education and social policy professor at Northwestern University, who evaluated the program a few years ago.', 'What kind of regulations do the schools face?', 'Students who use scholarships to attend these schools don’t take statewide standardized tests, but they do take another exam, with separately reported results.', 'Schools that get $250,000 a year from the scholarship program must have an independent certified public accountant file an audit on its financial practices, to make sure they aren’t misusing the public funds.', 'A number of private schools that get scholarship money specifically for serving students with disabilities have had problems, such as fraud and forgery. When Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos called Florida a model for school reform, Megan Allen, a former state teacher of the year, responded on Twitter that she “wouldn’t recommend” it.', 'How do students who use the scholarship money perform academically?', 'Figlio said his research shows that, on average, “students did no better and no worse than I predicted they would have done had they stayed in public school.” Despite that finding, some private schools did significantly better than public schools, while others did worse. Figlio found no patterns among the bottom and top performers.', 'Voucher opponents worry that diverting public money to private schools could spell the death of traditional public schools. Did vouchers hurt public schools in Florida?', 'No. To some extent, they have helped.', 'Slight improvements were reported in public schools that suddenly found themselves having to compete against private schools for students and money.', 'What might a national tax credit scholarship look like?', 'Trump has provided few specifics, but Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, a right-leaning think tank, believes that one option could involve tax credit scholarships that could be used across state lines. “If that goes through, it could mean that vouchers are coming to California,” Petrilli said.', 'Californians twice voted down ballot initiatives proposing voucher programs. The possibility of vouchers concerns some state officials. If more private schools open as a result, said Mike Kirst, president of the State Board of Education, school districts will see significantly less money from the state.', 'How could a voucher program become law?', 'Congress could attach a tax credit scholarship to a tax reform bill in an effort to bypass the education committees and bring along some Republicans who want tax reform but might otherwise oppose vouchers. Teachers unions and other school choice critics have vowed to fight any such plan. ', 'Trump’s visit to the Florida school divided at least one household, too — at least a little. Myrna Saint-Juste and her son, Marcus Millen, 16, a St. Andrew graduate, were invited by the school to come speak to Trump.', 'Saint-Juste, a Haitian immigrant and Hillary Clinton voter, agrees with Trump on school choice, but that’s about it.

At best, it has found small gains for some groups of students and the public school systems\xa0they leave — and\xa0at worst, studies show that students who used vouchers have lost ground academically.', '“But we have no idea what would happen if those voucher programs get big,”\xa0said David Figlio, an education and social policy professor\xa0at Northwestern University\xa0who has evaluated voucher systems.', 'In Florida, he said, students who move to private schools\xa0as part of a statewide voucher program\xa0don’t do better or worse, but the schools they leave improve a little because the voucher program inspires\xa0them to compete.\xa0In Ohio and Louisiana,\xa0students who use vouchers sometimes\xa0score worse than their public school peers on state tests.', 'DeVos got involved with vouchers in the 1990s, when she and her husband, a billionaire investor who is the son of Amway’s founder,\xa0began managing a small\xa0national organization that gave scholarships to low-income children to attend their schools of \xa0choice.', 'Religion was a draw. DeVos told the Philanthropy Roundtable in 2013 how a visit when her own children were school-aged\xa0to\xa0Potter’s House, a private Christian\xa0school in Grand Rapids, Mich., that served low-income families, led her to start supporting the school.', 'To DeVos, vouchers offered not just help for\xa0the disadvantaged\xa0but\xa0a way to “advance God’s kingdom,” she told a group of evangelicals 15 years ago\xa0at a meeting called the Gathering,\xa0as Politico first reported.', 'For months after she was named superintendent of the nation’s second-largest school system, Michelle King borrowed a strategy new politicians use to get the lay of the land:\xa0She traversed the\xa0territory\xa0on a “listen and learn”\xa0tour.', 'Although she had been working in the district for 31 years, she\xa0held...', 'For months after she was named superintendent of the nation’s second-largest school system, Michelle King borrowed a strategy new politicians use to get the lay of the land:\xa0She traversed the\xa0territory\xa0on a “listen and learn”\xa0tour.', 'Although she had been working in the district for 31 years, she\xa0held...', 'A Wall Street Journal article\xa0in 2000 described\xa0her\xa0as a political volunteer who spent\xa0time “crisscrossing Michigan in a huge Lincoln Navigator with a Bible in the seat pocket.” She started and ended some meetings\xa0with voucher supporters in\xa0prayer.', 'The Rev. Robert Sirico met DeVos through her husband, who invited him to a fundraiser for a group that screened Christian films. Over the years,\xa0Sirico saw DeVos in\xa0many personals settings\xa0—\xa0when her\xa0father died as well as\xa0at family weddings.\xa0', 'The Roman Catholic priest described DeVos’ political work as “guided or contextualized by faith,” but added that\xa0“she’s not this jihadist.\xa0She’s not a fundamentalist who wants to withdraw from the world and condemn everybody else.”\xa0', 'To advance her\xa0educational\xa0causes, DeVos\xa0founded in 2000 the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit and advocacy group that advances school choice.\xa0In 2010,\xa0DeVos created\xa0the American Federation for\xa0Children, a Washington, D.C.-based\xa0organization that gave Trump advice on his voucher plan. The group has\xa0poured money into the coffers of voucher-friendly candidates in such states as Louisiana and\xa0Indiana. In 2014, it reported spending $4.5 million on 243 races.\xa0', 'It\xa0probably\xa0would\xa0not be difficult for DeVos,\xa0as Education secretary, to spur the growth of existing voucher programs, such as those in Milwaukee, Ohio, Florida or Louisiana. Some experts say DeVos\xa0might be able to find a way to adjust\xa0funding regulations to allow\xa0money\xa0earmarked for\xa0educating poor children to pay for private school, although that’s an idea that has\xa0bounced\xa0around Congress\xa0without action\xa0for decades.\xa0', 'Still, regardless of the relatively large size of the Title I\xa0fund, given current funding levels,\xa0distribution per child likely would be less than the average private school tuition\xa0and\xa0thus unlikely to cause a major national shift.', '“With the election of Donald Trump and his support of school choice, school vouchers will move in states where people want to have them,” said Gerard Robinson, a former Florida and Virginia\xa0schools chief who served on the Trump transition team and is a\xa0scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\xa0', 'But what about states that are less-hospitable to vouchers?', 'California — like DeVos\xa0—\xa0has been here before. On two occasions, initiatives\xa0to start\xa0school voucher\xa0programs have appeared on state ballots. Twice, residents have voted no.', 'The most recent attempt was in 2000, when Menlo Park venture capitalist Timothy Draper pushed a proposal that would have given school-aged children about $4,000 each\xa0toward\xa0private school\xa0tuitions. He found an ally in DeVos, who that year was\xa0bankrolling and stumping for\xa0a similar initiative in Michigan.\xa0', 'DeVos and Draper fed each other tips on how to convince voters.\xa0“We helped each other to the extent we could. We each had a mission,” Draper said, recalling phone conversations with DeVos and her husband.', 'In California, 71.3% voted against vouchers in Michigan, 69.1% said no.\xa0', 'In promoting the Michigan initiative, DeVos faced a setback. A longtime ally, then-Gov. John Engler, did not support the measure, leading DeVos to resign from her party chairmanship.\xa0He said the idea’s time had not yet come, and he didn’t think the public was ready to vote yes.', 'Now,\xa0DeVos\xa0may get\xa0to float the idea again\xa0—\xa0on a much bigger scale.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Together, Snap Inc.’s 2,000 employees helped turn the Venice start-up into a $37-billion public company. Now, the question is whether they’ll do the same on their own. ', 'The region’s tech community is hoping the wealth unleashed to hundreds of Snap Inc. employees by the third-largest initial public offering in California history spurs them to become entrepreneurs and investors in their own right. Snap employees already are having conversations with venture capitalists to help line up future funding.', '“The key ingredients are there: a bunch of young, smart people with good money that are in tight conditions,” said Tamim Mourad, who co-founded four successive local companies in 20 years. “This is going to be huge for the L.A. tech ecosystem.”', 'Workers peeling off after an IPO or an acquisition — both of which give employees a chance to turn start-up shares into cash — is a common phenomenon. Some people prefer returning to a smaller, more nimble operation where bureaucracy doesn’t stifle their bold ideas. Others view their new fortune both as a calling card that boosts their reputation and a safety net that hedges against the financial risks of entrepreneurship. Many just get dragged along for the ride by an entrepreneurial co-worker.', 'Companies often try to prevent an exodus of institutional knowledge. They continually shift flight risks to the most interesting projects, or they dangle more stock in the company in exchange for continued service.', "Employees at Snap, the maker of the popular disappearing messaging and entertainment app Snapchat, are now sitting on billions of dollars’ worth of shares. But more than half of the company’s employees joined in the last 18 months or so, and most of the stock in their pay package doesn't arrive until their third and fourth years of employment. That’s a powerful incentive to stick around. In addition, Snap went public at an early stage, and its co-founders hold an outsized vision for the company’s potential. Those factors could lead people to believe the fortune waiting ahead of them at Snap is unbeatable.", '“This is going to be the most interesting tech story we’ve ever had in Los Angeles, so there’s going to be desire to stay with that mothership for a little while,” said Eytan Elbaz, who has co-founded four local companies, including one that sold to Google. “But over time, maybe three years out, a lot more will go out on their own.”', 'Ev Williams and Biz Stone left Google shortly after the search giant’s 2004 IPO, and they soon co-founded what eventually became Twitter. Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, employees at PayPal when it was acquired by EBay, co-founded YouTube. “Shark Tank” investor Chris Sacca started funding start-ups after the Google IPO.', 'In Los Angeles, the sale of Myspace to News Corp. in 2005 spawned more than a handful of start-ups. The acquisitions of companies such as Elbaz’s Applied Semantics and Mourad’s PriceGrabber and the IPOs of Boingo Wireless, Rubicon Project and Demand Media also led to new clusters of companies.', 'But these spores, sometimes called start-up mafias because of the close ties between the colleagues-turned-entrepreneurs, will be dwarfed by the scale many Los Angeles tech leaders anticipate for Snap.', '“Snap’s IPO is a historic multiplier for our city’s tech sector,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. “It has great potential to power new dreams, create more opportunity and drive innovation in what is already one of the world’s largest tech hubs.”', 'Several Los Angeles venture capitalists said they collectively know about 20 people at Snap who have voiced increasing interest in forming their own business or investment fund, though timing remains uncertain.', '“It’s not running away from Snapchat. It’s running toward their next great challenge,” said Crosscut Ventures managing partner Rick Smith. “And if you’ve been sitting in Snap, you’re bringing a lot of know-how.”', 'Upfront Ventures’ Mark Suster said his team spends an “inordinate amount of time building relationships” with people at Snap because “one day, those people are going to build the next generation of the Internet.”', 'Software companies tend to breed more of their ilk than other firms because programmers realize what they’ve developed for one industry can be affordably rejiggered for use in another.', 'Leaving comes with other risks, though. Companies generally don’t welcome back people who want to return down the road, said Marissa Peretz, a former recruiter at Tesla Motors in Los Angeles who recently co-founded Silicon Beach Talent. And most start-ups don’t turn into billion-dollar businesses.', 'And there are other reasons to stay longer. Snap’s employees are valuable because they’ve seen what it takes to take a company public. Learning the basics of operating in a public company will make them even more valuable, said Michael Blend, who was promoted to chief operating officer and president at Santa Monica online media company Demand Media after it went public in 2011.', '“As they grow into a much bigger company, there’s going to be a lot of learning opportunities for the people there,” Blend said. “It’s a huge product, but it’s just beginning to be a big, huge business.”', 'Blend stuck around at Demand until 2013 before co-founding OpenMail, a now 180-person Venice start-up working on marketing software. Blend’s colleagues formed at least five other companies, and he invested in three of them, including Venice-based mediation app maker Stop, Breathe &amp Think.', '“There’s no obligation to invest in people’s companies,” he said. “Friends miss deals all the time, but if I believe in and trust the person, it’s a good deal.”', 'The significance of now leading the region’s third-most valuable public company behind Walt Disney and Amgen isn’t lost on Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who was born and raised in Los Angeles. The day after Wednesday’s IPO, he wouldn’t comment on whether he plans to expand his role locally, for instance by investing his own money in start-ups. (He said he would continue investing in youth arts education and other local arts programs through Snap and the newly minted Snap Foundation).', 'But Snap can count it a triumph, he said, if its success inspires more people to come to Los Angeles to create content. His company’s mission is to reinvent the camera, and tech start-ups and entertainment firms experimenting with digital video will play a role.', '“We’re part of a huge number of businesses in L.A. built on top of the camera,” he said.', 'Assuming Snap’s continued growth, former employees succeeding in their own start-ups could reflect well on Spiegel.', '“That’s one of the best legacies a founder can leave,” said Therese Tucker, chief executive of accounting software firm BlackLine, which went public last year. “You’re showing you passed a whole set of knowledge to another generation.”', 'Still, it’s unfortunate when people want to leave. Tucker herself has seen both ends. She left a couple of years’ worth of stock options on the table to found BlackLine after the small software firm at which she had been working was bought out. She also has had people at BlackLine forgo big payouts to open their own ventures.', 'Fortunately, she said, there are few individuals “who have the stomach to quit their jobs and starve for 10 years” to be an entrepreneur.', 'But in the interest of the Los Angeles tech scene, she too is betting there are a lot of them at Snap.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

For more than a decade, two highly intertwined issues have dominated the political debate in Venice: gentrification and homelessness.', 'The oceanside district, once a shabby haven for artists and hippies, has been transformed into one of L.A.’s most expensive and trendy neighborhoods. The already hot real estate market went into overdrive in recent years with the rise of Snap Inc. and other tech companies that make up Silicon Beach.', 'But as Venice has gotten richer, the situation has gotten more desperate for the people at the bottom. The Venice Boardwalk has long attracted homeless people, and many believe the numbers have increased in recent years, stoking tension in the neighborhood.', 'Now, voters in City Council District 11 — which includes Venice, Mar Vista, Westchester and other neighboring communities — are set to weigh in on the twin controversies.', 'Councilman Mike Bonin is seeking reelection Tuesday, and the vote is shaping up to be a referendum on his policies on homelessness and development.', 'Bonin has focused much of his first term trying to find a policy to deal with the homeless problem.', 'His detailed plans have divided the district. Some praise Bonin for making bold proposals on homelessness, while others worry these ideas will turn Venice into even more of a homeless magnet. His cleanup plan, critics say, will mean security guards harassing the homeless and lead to more gentrification. A plan to turn an abandoned senior center in Venice into a storage facility for homeless people and a plan to use public land for homeless housing have also been hotly debated.', 'Much of the district’s rapid upscale development over the last few years is also seen through different lenses. Some like all the new eateries and shops and don’t mind Venice’s chic vibe.  But others say Bonin has not done enough to control development, which they say has worsened traffic, led to ugly and impractical housing projects and made the district even less affordable for people of modest means.', 'Venice is famous for its political activism, and these debates are fierce. Bonin is being challenged by two mainstays in the political life of Venice: Robin Rudisill and Mark Ryavec.', 'Rudisill has been a member of the Venice Neighborhood Council and is a community and coastal advocate. An accountant, she was an outspoken critic of the California Coastal Commission when the board fired its executive director last year.', 'Ryavec founded and leads the Venice Stakeholders Assn., which advocates for neighborhood improvements. He’s also worked in politics before and previously served as a real estate lobbyist — even working for Donald Trump when he tried to develop the Ambassador Hotel site almost 30 years ago.', 'On a sunny day last month, Ryavec pulled up to an encampment at Rose and 3rd avenues in a white Audi where dozens of homeless men and women were situated with their belongings. “People just store their crap here,” he said.', 'It’s illegal to store belongings overnight, but they do, he noted. Part of his plan would be to ban homeless storage units within 300 feet of any residences and for the police to enforce current laws.', 'The encampment has been a source of tension between Ryavec and other Venice residents. In February, former Venice Neighborhood Council President Linda Lucks glanced off an email to her friends and associates about Ryavec and how, in 2012, he posted her home address and the addresses of nine others online.', 'Ryavec objected to their opposition to his goal of clearing homeless people’s belongings and trash along the drag. He sardonically wrote that these folks shouldn’t mind if people sleep outside their homes, then offered homeless individuals $20 if they camped outside their homes.', '“My plea to you is not to fall for the glossy mailers presenting a mild mannered person. He is the opposite,” Lucks wrote.', 'For his part, Ryavec, who eventually took some addresses down, said a death threat he received justified his actions. He called the residents who express sympathy for the homeless as long as they’re not outside their homes hypocrites. That some of them felt threatened was his only regret.', 'Rudisill criticized Bonin’s opposition to Measure S, which would restrict development in the city, and his support of a large development project at West Olympic Boulevard and Bundy Drive that will create hundreds of apartments and hundreds of thousands of square feet in office space.', '“Every neighborhood I go to feels betrayed that he’s very nontransparent and making poor decisions,” she said. “He’s approving projects that are significantly reducing the quality of life.”', 'Bonin addressed those concerns as he sat in his cramped but bustling campaign office on a recent Friday night.', 'His volunteers were hurriedly folding signs and making calls. His 3-year-old son, Jacob, ran around flipping the lights off and on.', '”You always have pockets of people who have gripes. That’s legitimate,” Bonin said.', 'Cities can’t enforce  their way out of homelessness, Bonin said, adding that courts have said it’s unconstitutional. The solution, he said, is more housing and more services for homeless individuals — many of whom suffer from severe mental illness or substance problems.', 'Hating the traffic is one source of agreement in a district where most questions of policy turn into political food fights. Bonin points out that he secured $2 million from the city to relieve the jams that occur on Sunset Boulevard near the 405 Freeway.', 'It’s an issue on which he solicited community input and hustled to find a solution, he said.', 'At a recent candidate forum, one person held up a sign, “Venice 4 Sale Mike Bonin Realty.” Ryavec didn’t attend but sent recorded responses to questions.', 'When asked about the homeless situation at Rose and 3rd avenues, both challengers pounced.', '“[Bonin has] done almost nothing to protect residents from the burden of these encampments,” Ryavec said.', 'After Rudisill spoke, Bonin addressed the audience,  saying it seemed  Ryavec cribbed many of his ideas from his platform.', '“If there’s a single reason why we have a culture of encampments and tents... it’s because of the failed strategy that Mr. Ryavec and people like him have advocated,” Bonin said to cheers. “That is a strategy, which has said we need to enforce our way out of homelessness.”', 'As the candidates made their closing statements, Sergio Diaz of Mar Vista said Bonin had offered the most substantive answers throughout the night. He had voted for Bonin in 2013 but had been disappointed by his tenure.', '“As much as I’m not a fan of Bonin, he clearly knows how the city works,” he said.', 'Lucks, who is not endorsing a candidate, agrees. She believes that Rudisill could be a stout advocate for the district. ', 'But she said the notion that Bonin has acted without consulting the community on homelessness and traffic problems isn’t true.', 'On his homeless initiative, “I know there were years of meetings in the social services and activists and community leader,” Lucks said. “He’s being sandbagged as a lone wolf, and I know that’s not true.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Southern California air quality officials voted Friday to impose tougher rules on oil refineries but rejected a proposal to regulate pollution from ports and warehouses, which are responsible for much of the region’s harmful emissions.', 'The South Coast Air Quality Management District’s 15-year smog-reduction plan, approved on an 11-2 vote, will guide efforts to slash emissions as required to meet federal health standards and reduce harm to 17 million people in the nation’s smoggiest region.', 'But it will rely on only voluntary measures from ports, warehouses and rail yards.', 'The $16-billion plan is expected to prevent thousands of asthma-related emergency room visits and an estimated 1,600 early deaths a year from air pollution. These benefits, according to an air district analysis, will outweigh the costs to industry, taxpayers and consumers.', 'But the effort faces immediate obstacles because of its hefty price tag.', 'Successful implementation would require boosting local, state and federal spending on cash incentives for cleaner vehicles to $1 billion a year — a tenfold increase — at a time when the Trump administration is moving to slash environmental regulations and impose sweeping cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.', '“This plan relies very, very heavily on a whole bunch of money that we don’t have in our pocket,” said board member Joseph Lyou, who heads the Coalition for Clean Air.', 'The panel voted 7 to 6 to accelerate existing efforts to reduce smog-forming emissions under AQMD’s troubled pollution-trading program, known as the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market, or RECLAIM. Then, “as soon practicable,” the newly approved plan will replace RECLAIM’s “cap and trade” approach with traditional “command and control” regulations on emissions from specific sources.', 'The program for nitrogen oxide pollution was established in 1993 to offer flexibility to refineries, power plants and other large facilities.', 'But state regulators, lawmakers and environmental groups have attacked it for falling short of promised reductions and allowing refineries to avoid installing readily available pollution controls.', 'Environmentalists applauded regulators’ decision to sunset the cap-and-trade program but accused them of ducking their obligation to clean up the freight industry.', '“We can’t get to our clean air goals if the ports and warehouses don’t do their share to reduce emissions,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros, an attorney for Earthjustice. “They let those two major sources skate.”', 'Under the newly approved plan, the agency will seek cooperation from goods-movement hubs that attract large numbers of trucks, ships and locomotives, asking them to make their own pollution reductions. The air district will pivot to rulemaking mode only if the facilities fail to agree to adequate measures within a year.', 'Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino said he expected the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to sign an agreement with the air district and “commit to firm dates with emission reduction goals.”', 'Cargo-moving industries have long opposed local pollution regulations, arguing they will stifle job growth in a sector that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, while environmentalists have pressed for stricter measures to protect public health.', 'Tracy Hernandez, chief executive of the Los Angeles County Business Federation, said she was still digesting the late amendments to the plan but remained concerned about their effect. The elimination of the RECLAIM program will be “rough” on oil refiners, she said. “The likely impact is increased cost. And someone’s going to pay for it somehow.”', 'Also included in the plan was an amendment by board member Clark E. Parker Sr. that will prioritize incentive spending on “the most cost-effective technologies,” such as low-emitting natural gas engines for heavy-duty trucks.', 'Diesel-fueled big rigs are the region’s top source of nitrogen oxides. Though the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex has slashed emissions over the last decade, it remains the single largest air pollution source in Southern California, according to the air district.', 'To meet federal deadlines to reduce ozone, the lung-damaging gas in smog, the region must go beyond existing regulations to slash smog-forming gases called nitrogen oxides 45% by 2023 and an additional 10% by 2031.', 'The South Coast basin, which spans Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, has the nation’s highest ozone pollution. Though air quality has improved dramatically over decades, progress has faltered in recent years. The region still does not meet a series of federal health standards going back to 1979.', 'The plan’s approval follows a heated public hearing last month that drew more than 500 people and hours of testimony. Friday’s hearing had no public comment, but the district’s Diamond Bar hearing room was packed with industry representatives and Sierra Club members, who held a rally outside.', 'The plan now goes to the California Air Resources Board for consideration and must then be approved by the EPA to become enforceable under the federal Clean Air Act.', 'In other business Friday, the air board adopted long-delayed regulations on toxic emissions from grinding and cutting operations at 22 metal-forging facilities across the region. The rules, which require such operations occur inside enclosed buildings, came in response to years of community complaints about noxious odors from metal-processing plants in the city of Paramount.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Labor unions, builders, real estate and investment companies, entertainers, lawyers and nonprofits have recently given hundreds of thousands of dollars to bolster the campaign for Measure H, the proposed sales tax increase to fund homeless programs.', 'Measure H on Tuesday’s ballot would generate a projected $3.55 billion over 10 years. The quarter-cent tax increase would raise the sales tax rate to 9% across most of Los Angeles County and up to 10% in a few communities. Because it would increase taxes, it requires a two-thirds majority to pass.', 'A surge of support in the last two weeks of February brought in $200,000 from Wanda America Investment Holding Co., a subsidiary of the Chinese company that is buying Dick Clark Productions and is building a mixed-use tower in Beverly Hills $100,000 from Disney Worldwide Services Inc. and $50,000 each from the L.A. Chargers and USC.', 'The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the California Medical Assn., Onni Contracting California Inc. — a subsidiary of the Canadian company that owns the Los Angeles Times building — Mercury General Corp., sports executive Casey Wasserman, construction management firm HNTB Corp., former Mayor Richard Riordan, Brookfield Properties Management, philanthropist William Bloomfield and the Downtown Women’s Center each contributed $20,000 to $30,000.', 'Measure H was placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors in December. If it passes, the funds will be spent exclusively on homelessness programs including rental housing, homeless prevention and case management and clinical support for homeless people who have been housed.', 'Measure H is designed to complement Proposition HHH, the $1.2-billion housing bond measure approved by Los Angeles city voters in November.', ' Voters gave Proposition HHH a resounding victory with 77% in favor, validating polls that consistently showed homelessness as among the voters’ highest concerns.', 'Pollsters say the countywide measure faces a greater challenge because the electorate is older and more conservative than in November’s election. Tuesday’s ballot includes no state or federal races, making voter turnout harder to gauge.', "“Some cities have nothing else on the ballot,” said Steve Barkan of SG&ampA Campaigns, who is managing the campaign for Measure H. “In others we're competing for attention with campaigns that have been saturating mailboxes.”", 'By Thursday, the campaign had reported raising just under $3.4 million.', 'There has been no organized opposition to Measure H, and no group filed a ballot argument against it.', 'However, Larry Buford, a South Los Angeles resident who lives next to a recently completed homeless housing project, posted a critique of the measure on a community news website, saying he thinks it lacks transparency.', '“What’s disturbing is that not a hint of how the funds will be apportioned has been rolled out before the vote,” Buford wrote.', 'In an interview with The Times, Buford complained that the project near his home was approved by the county with insufficient parking despite community opposition.', 'Los Angeles County officials plan to appoint a panel of 50 people engaged in homelessness issues to recommend how the funds will be spent. The group will hold meetings open to the public  and is scheduled to make its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors in June.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

A Los Angeles City Council member running for reelection is facing questions about whether his divorce ever became final before he remarried.', 'South L.A. Councilman Curren Price, 66, is married to entrepreneur Del Richardson, according to his campaign spokesman.', 'More than three decades ago, Price married Lynn Suzette Green in Annandale, Va. He sought a divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2006 and refiled the action in 2011.', 'But the court records do not indicate that the divorce was ever granted. The case remains open, according to court records and a court spokeswoman.', 'Price and his legal team are trying to locate records that would prove the divorce was finalized.', '“Mr. Price has been operating on the belief that his divorce is full and final,” said his campaign spokesman, Josh Pulliam. “Based on the questions raised in the past few days, he immediately requested all of the files and records regarding the divorce so we can get this resolved.”', 'Price did not respond when asked if he pursued a divorce from Lynn Suzette Price somewhere other than L.A. County.', 'Albert Robles, who represented Price in the divorce, insisted it was final.', '“Curren Price is divorced, end of story,” Robles said in a statement. “I was Curren Price’s attorney my office filed the paperwork. As far as Curren Price is concerned, his divorce was settled years ago and that’s what was communicated to Mr. Price at the time.”', 'Questions about Price’s divorce — first reported by the news site CityWatch — come as the South L.A. politician seeks reelection in District 9, where he faces two challengers in Tuesday’s election.', 'Bigamy is rarely prosecuted in California. Additionally, a judge will consider whether an individual had a “reasonable, good faith” reason to believe he or she was single or whether there was a court error.', 'Virginia Department of Health records show that Price, then 30, and 25-year-old Green were married on Aug. 1, 1981.', 'Price filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2006, court records show. His attorney later filed documents with the court saying his wife, Lynn Suzette Price, could not be located. A judge dismissed the case in 2011, citing procedural concerns.', 'Later in 2011, Price again filed for divorce. That case is listed as “pending” in court records.', 'Lynn Suzette Price, an attorney in Trenton, N.J., did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Curren Price’s reelection website says that he is married to Richardson and that the couple have “raised two kids and are the proud grandparents of three.”', 'The councilman declined this week to say when and where he married Richardson.', '“Del and I are married, but out of respect for her privacy and due to the fact that she has been a recent victim of identity theft and fraud, we have been advised to keep the additional private details about our wedding private,” Price said in a statement.', 'Richardson runs a consulting company, Del Richardson &amp Associates. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority awarded her company a contract in 2014 to help businesses affected by local transit construction.', 'Ronald M. Supancic, a Woodland Hills-based family law attorney who has taught at USC, said it’s not uncommon for an individual to file for divorce and mistakenly believe that a court finalized the order.', '“There are probably 10,000 people walking around Los Angeles County who think they are divorced and who are not,” Supancic said.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

The art forms of film and theater don’t often overlap. With the exception of the occasional adaptation — and the even more occasional filmed play — what happens on stage stays on the stage. Ditto for the screen.', 'Travis Wilkerson is keen to break down those barriers, along with a few others. The Alabama-born documentarian has created “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun,” an uncategorizably hybrid work that officially goes down as a documentary but in fact serves as many other things: murder inquiry, family confession, race meditation, multimedia stage show, film deconstruction.', "The artist is screening the work in this Midwestern college town this weekend at True/False, the prestigious documentary festival that both reflects and sets the tone for the nonfiction film world's latest trends.", 'The story stems from the knowledge the director, who is white, has about his family’s past. Or doesn’t have. In 1946, Bill Spann, a Southern black man, was killed by Wilkerson’s gun-wielding great-grandfather S.E. Branch at the latter’s grocery store. There is little doubt Branch did it, and equally no ambiguity that the crime was eventually expunged without record, let alone prosecution. Needless to say, the incident was almost never discussed in the Wilkerson home.', 'The artist’s presentation here distinguishes it from other documentaries with which its classified. As still photos, quotes, archived video footage and other shards of material flash on the screen, the director sits on a stage, laptop open, narrating much of what we see. Because the voice-over is happening in front of us, the feature has an intimate, alive quality, at times uncomfortably so.', 'Wilkerson’s piece, ruminative in the way of the recent Oscar nominee “I Am Not Your Negro,” is founded on a simple question many of us ask about our familes: how can I come from these people?', 'That leads him down numerous narrative alleys and philosophical cul-de-sacs (sometimes literally, as he shoots a front-seat view down an Alabama road to Phil Ochs\' ode-to-a-fallen-hero "William Moore," from which the film’s title comes). There’s everything from Rosa Parks\' little-known history as a feminist activist long before the Montgomery bus boycott to an aunt who went from civil-rights activism to white nationalism over the past half-century. At a key moment on stage Wilkerson reads a letter from her about the Spann murder, describing the constructed, blameless reality she\'s created as he shakes his head in disbelief.', '"This isn’t a white-savior story. It\'s a white nightmare story," he says at one point of his exploration.', 'This condemnation is made even louder by the form Wilkerson chooses. Because the person doing the confessing, and the blaming, is in front of us, it becomes that much harder for the audience to exempt itself.', '"A single-channel [non-multimedia] movie is a way to remove myself and hide behind the screen," Wilkerson said after the screening. "This way I couldn\'t hide." (He said he hopes to release a version with voice-over built in, for expediency’s sake.)', 'When matters turn political Wilkerson is unflinching: “I don’t want to give [Southern secessionists] a platform, because white nationalists are in the White House,” he narrates. But he mostly hopes to offer his own reckoning with the past. The title is rhetorical, aimed at his family that never bothered to ask the question, and a rebuke to himself, as a filmmaker who had gone most of his 48 years without looking into what happened that fateful day.', 'At times Wilkerson is even intent on pointing the finger, provocatively, at white people generally for a complicity that allowed such racism to flourish. The Ochs refrain closes with a mea culpa reveal. "Did you wonder who had fired the gun?/Did you know that it was you who fired the gun?"', 'Filmed often in a black-and-white palette that paradoxically heightens the color-based differences underlying the film, "Gun" is a story both highly personal and unfailingly universal. At a moment when Oscar winner “Moonlight” explores race from new storytelling angles, Wilkerson adds an important voice to the chorus', 'He said in making the movie he hoped for some kind of justice or closure. But he soon came to the conclusion that wasn\'t possible. "It\'s shameful I\'m embarrassed. There\'s no satisfying way to rectify it," he said of the events in the movie.', '"It doesn\'t have any restorative justice or power. It\'s just confession," he added.', 'See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

For the second time in a month, Berkeley was the scene of violent demonstrations as supporters of President Trump clashed with counter-protesters Saturday on the streets of the city.', 'At least 10 people were arrested and seven others were injured as a series of disturbances marred what was supposed to be a pro-Trump rally in the famously liberal community.', 'The unrest underscores the heightened political tensions that have taken hold since Trump took office in January.', 'Last month a scheduled appearance by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled amid a violent protest on the UC Berkeley campus. That sparked a national debate — in which Trump himself took part — about the line between the right to demonstrate and protecting free speech that some find objectionable. ', 'Saturday’s “March 4 Trump” rally, one of several held across the country, began at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park about 2 p.m.', 'The Trump supporters marched several blocks but were met by a group of counter-demonstrators, and fights began breaking out, according to Matthai Chakko, a spokesman for the city of Berkeley.', 'Videos and photos posted on Twitter showed people punching each other and pulling their hair, with one man using an unidentified object to beat another person. Several people in the crowd were pepper-sprayed, including an elderly man.', 'At least two people, with their faces covered up, could be seen on video trying to set fire to an American flag, while a photo on Twitter showed the bloody face of a man who wore a T-shirt that said “Trump is My President.”', 'Amy Leona Masker, a 23-year-old student from Las Positas College in Livermore who was on crutches, was among the counter-demonstrators. She and a fellow student were standing together when they saw the fighting break out.', '“These crutches came in handy when people started shoving,” Masker said.', 'She and the other student said one of the Trump supporters, who wore a gas mask and had a wooden shield, was one of the pepper-sprayers. They said there were several isolated fights, but when they erupted, people from both sides tried to break them up.', 'Masker said she came out to “support what really is our country.”', 'Nancy Chase, who held a sign reading “Grandmothers for Trump,” told an SFGATE reporter that she was there to show support for the president “in a positive way.”', '“I’m not looking for violence,” she said. “These people just want to fight. They are anarchists in black, and it’s not what we are about. I just want to stand up for liberty.”', 'David Tomes, another pro-Trump marcher, told the Bay Area newspaper, said “this is the most immature and disgusting display of human interaction.”', 'Berkeley Police Officer Byron White said 10 arrests were made: one for resisting arrest, four for assault with a deadly weapon, including a dagger, and five for battery.

Ed Sheeran’s sentimental streak is matched only by his determination to win on “÷,” the British singer’s third album of shrewdly conceived love songs in which every last detail feels arranged for maximum impact.', 'Introduced as a sensitive folkie on his hit 2011 debut, “+,” Sheeran became a superstar with 2014’s more expansive “x.” The record sold millions of copies, led to sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and spawned a modern wedding standard in “Thinking Out Loud,” which won the Grammy Award for song of the year.', 'Here was a guy, it seemed as his profile kept rising, proud to have learned early on that “heart” rhymes with “chart.”', 'Yet by the end of 2015 Sheeran’s longed-for success was pushing him toward burnout. So he spent the next year mostly out of sight, traveling the world without a cellphone (or so he’s said).', 'In his absence, he also cleared a path for a new group of nice guitar guys such as Shawn Mendes and Charlie Puth, each of whom developed a following they might not have had Sheeran still been in the mix.', 'Now Sheeran’s back, and he’s eager to reclaim his spot at the top.', 'Pronounced “divide” (after the earlier records called “plus” and “multiply”), “÷” contains the singer’s clearest bids for Top 40 penetration. “Shape of You,” one of two lead singles — and the current No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 — is a slinky electro-pop come-on with traces of the tropical-house style familiar from recent hits by Justin Bieber and Kygo. The other single, “Castle on the Hill,” channels Coldplay channeling U2 for an openly nostalgic tune about missing one’s hometown.', '“Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,” he reminisces with an audible lump in his throat, “Had my first kiss on a Friday night / I don’t reckon that I did it right.”', 'Then there’s the handful of shamelessly goopy ballads, including the John Mayer-ish “How Would You Feel (Paean),” complete with soft-rock guitar solo by John Mayer, and “Perfect,” which Sheeran has said he wrote expressly to outdo “Thinking Out Loud.”', '“I found a love to carry more than just my secrets / To carry love, to carry children of our own,” he sings, and you can already see the countless first dances taking awkward shape in your mind.', 'As calculating as Sheeran can seem here, he understands there’s a fine line between universal and generic, which is why he gives his songs the idiosyncratic touches they need to stand out.', 'In “Castle on the Hill” it’s a line about how he knows he and his friends have matured because it’s been ages since they’ve thrown up from drinking too much in “Supermarket Flowers,” which documents his grandmother’s funeral, it’s the painful specificity of the images — nightgowns folded “neatly in a case” and so on.', 'The new album also reflects Sheeran’s travels with several tunes full of local flavor.

The three races for the Los Angeles Board of Education are the most expensive school board contests in the country because opposing special interests — charter-school advocates and the local teachers union — are spending millions to back favored candidates.', 'Other hopefuls for the seats are getting none of this money to get their messages out. But they’d like you to know about them, too.', 'In District 6, the east San Fernando Valley, charter school supporters are spending the most, on behalf of Kelly Gonez, while Imelda Padilla benefits from the other big-money backer, United Teachers Los Angeles.', 'But also in the race is Araz Parseghian, 37, who had raised $42,910 through the March 1 reporting period. His pitch is that he’s the parent of young children — the oldest in kindergarten — so he has a stake in the district. He said he also comes with financial experience that would help the board. He’s a bank loan officer and said he’s trained employees for leadership positions in previous banking jobs.', 'His volunteer roles include a stint on his neighborhood council and on the 16-member board of the Los Angeles Valley College Foundation, which raises scholarship money.', 'Gwendolyn Posey, 47, who hadn’t reported raising any money, has the business experience of managing an event-planning company.', 'She sent two children, now in their 20s, to a mix of traditional and charters schools. The youngest, 11, attends a charter. A longtime school volunteer, she’s held leadership positions in community groups.', 'Posey stresses school safety and making sure money gets to where it’s supposed to go at schools. She also wants to see more vocational education: “Right now, we’re doing kids an injustice on every campus,” she said, “because we’re not preparing them for life.”', 'Patty Lopez, 49, ran for the school board after a topsy-turvy turn in state government. First, she won an Assembly seat in an upset. Then, after one term, she lost it last November.', 'Even though Lopez reported no fundraising, California Charter Schools Assn. Advocates, a pro-charter political action committee, was concerned enough to send out negative mailers characterizing her as a “failed politician.”', 'Lopez, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico at 12, speaks Spanish fluidly but more painstakingly in English. She earned a high school diploma in adult school and hopes to complete a higher degree. The mother of four worked 16 years in a government-funded position at schools to help other parents learn English and become more engaged in schools.', 'Lopez took part in two lawsuits against L.A. Unified: one over the alleged waste of federal funds the other to ensure that all schools received adequate supplies and textbooks.', '“I am concerned about the district wasting money like with the iPads,” she said. “They have double positions where it is not needed. There should be more teachers in the classroom.”', 'The last person on the ballot, Jose Sandoval, 38, did not appear at the highest-profile candidates’ forum or reply to a request for information and reported no fundraising.', 'In filing papers, he described himself as an animal-rights educator. He has a web site that focuses on connecting Latino families with spaying and neutering services and other information on animal welfare.', 'In District 2, which includes downtown and nearby neighborhoods, veteran Roosevelt High teacher Lisa Alva, 56, proved to be a crowd favorite with an audience of mostly high school students during a recent campaign forum. She also successfully wooed the union representing district administrators, which endorsed her.', 'But her own union, United Teachers Los Angeles, held back, making no choice in the contest — possibly that’s because Alva has been critical at times of the union. Labor sources said they feared it would be wasting money to take on incumbent Monica Garcia, who has funding from charter backers and deep community ties.', 'At the campaign forum, Alva talked about classroom issues such as a district discipline program. She said it’s well-intentioned but poorly executed, sometimes making learning more difficult in the classroom. She’s raised $13,212 for her campaign.', 'Also in that race is Carl J. Petersen, 49, a father of five, including children with special needs.', '“The district made me fight for the services that my daughters’ teachers agreed they required,” he said.', 'Overall, his views probably align more closely with the teachers union than any other challenger. As a parent activist, he’s repeatedly targeted alleged misconduct at charter schools, through blog posts and public records requests.', 'He is director of logistics at a company that makes high-definition security cameras.', 'Petersen ran unsuccessfully two years ago for the west San Fernando Valley board seat, then moved to District 2 to run again. He’s raised $2,999.', 'Three of the four candidates in District 4, incumbent Steve Zimmer and challengers Allison Holdorff Polhill and Nick Melvoin, have considerable outside financial backing. Gregory Martayan, who’s raised $71,475, is the other one.', 'A longtime police department volunteer who stresses school safety issues, Martayan, 33, owns a communications firm and has children who are not yet school age. He’s a strong backer of charter schools but stresses his independence from the charter lobby as well as from unions. His outside-the-box ideas include providing kosher food at schools. He said doing so would attract enrollment from religious families — both Jewish and Muslim.', 'All the candidates without big-dollar donors expressed concerns similar to those articulated by District 6’s Posey.', '“I think it’s crazy,” Posey said. “With kids on campus needing so many resources, entities that claim they represent kids are using so much money to represent a candidate. It’s sad and a waste of money. I think your life skills and everything you’ve implemented in that community should speak for you and ultimately that’s who you’re beholden to.”', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

(March 6, 2017)', 'A combative White House refused to back down from President Trump’s unsubstantiated assertion that his predecessor ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower, demanding a congressional investigation into his claims, even as the director of the FBI took the extraordinary step of asking the Justice Department to publicly repudiate the president’s charge.  ', 'The statement Sunday by the White House and the appeal by FBI Director James B. Comey, which was confirmed by a Justice Department official, came on the heels of flat denials from former President Obama that he or his staff had authorized any such surveillance, and from the former director of national intelligence, who said no wiretapping had taken place.', 'The developments  added a bizarre new element to the swirl of intrigue surrounding Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.', 'The president’s Democratic opponents called the White House’s intimation of wrongdoing by Obama a  bid to deflect attention from growing scrutiny of Trump associates’ ties to Russian officials during the campaign. Trump and the Kremlin have called the investigations into Russian influence a “witch hunt.”', 'At least some Republicans signaled willingness to weigh Trump’s allegation. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), the head of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that an existing investigation by his panel would now also encompass “inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party’s campaign officials or surrogates.”', 'Other Republicans expressed more skepticism. If Trump has evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, “it would probably be helpful if he gave more information,” said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee “But it would also be helpful if he just didn’t comment further and allowed us to do our work.”', "The most striking repudiation came from Comey, who privately asked Justice Department officials to issue a statement rebutting Trump's assertion.", "Comey argued that the Justice Department should publicly reject the claim as false because it impugned the integrity of the FBI by raising the specter that agents had broken the law by tapping Trump's phones.", 'The Justice Department has taken no action on Comey’s request.', 'Mike Kortan, an FBI spokesman, and Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment.', "Despite Trump's allegations made on Twitter, the president and his campaign were not targeted in wiretaps, according to current and former U.S. officials. The FBI, however, is investigating Russia's meddling in the U.S. election and its potential ties to the Trump campaign or Trump associates, U.S. officials have said.", 'With authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the FBI has long been permitted to conduct electronic surveillance on Russian officials, suspected operatives and spies in the United States. It was that surveillance that picked up conversations Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, had in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.', 'Getting approval from the court to gather electronic surveillance on Trump or his campaign would require a finding by a judge of probable cause to believe either that they were involved in a crime or that they were agents of a foreign power.', "James R. Clapper, Obama's director of national intelligence, said no such warrant was obtained during his tenure to tap the phones of Trump or his campaign. He also said he had no knowledge of evidence that Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians. ", 'Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Clapper said that he would have been in a position to know if any surveillance warrant of Trump’s headquarters had been issued, and that none had been.', '“There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, as a candidate, or against his campaign,” Clapper said.', 'In a statement calling for a congressional inquiry of the former president, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer cited unspecified but “very troubling” reports of “politically motivated” investigations by Obama’s executive branch, but he did not offer any evidence to back up the claim or say where the reports originated.', 'The White House statement added that there would be no further comment from Trump or his team on the matter until congressional oversight of Obama’s actions had taken place, a stance that appeared designed not only to forestall opponents’ questions, but also perhaps to head off any further talk — or Twitter commentary — by the president himself.', 'Trump spent the weekend at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.', 'His string of tweets on Saturday, alleging wiretapping and personally attacking Obama as a “bad (or sick) guy,” seemed to have caught his own staff flat-footed — a pattern that has occurred frequently in his still-young administration, as aides have struggled to publicly parse unsupported Trump assertions without directly contradicting the president.', 'On Sunday, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, under extended questioning by ABC’s Martha Raddatz on “This Week,” seemed at a loss when asked how exactly the president had learned of the purported surveillance.', 'Essential Washington: Updates on the Trump administration and the rest of Washington »', '“I think he’s going off information that he’s seen,” she finally said, without providing any detail. Although he has access to detailed intelligence briefings, Trump is known to be an avid consumer of reports generated by conspiracy-minded websites and talk shows operating outside the journalistic mainstream.', 'An article published Friday on the Breitbart News website repeated a claim by conservative radio host Mark Levin about surveillance of the Trump campaign, although it is unclear whether the president was responding to that.', 'Russia’s role in the campaign has been a source of concern and confusion for months, beginning with Trump’s often-expressed affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin and continuing apace as the president denigrated the NATO alliance, declared he held Putin and close U.S. ally Angela Merkel in equal esteem, and suggested he would consider accepting Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula.', 'Questions over whether Trump’s transition team sought to assure Putin that Obama-imposed sanctions would be lifted after the president-elect took office led investigators to pore over phone conversations between Flynn and  Ambassador Kislyak. ', 'The national security advisor was forced out last month after only 24 days on the job when it emerged he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his discussions with Kislyak. ', 'Russia questions also tripped up Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, who during his confirmation hearingssaid he had not met with any Russians. In fact, he had met at least twice with Kislyak in the summer and fall. ', 'Sessions is to provide amended testimony on Monday in writing.', 'Amid the burgeoning scandal, even Republicans seemed to be hoping the president would not repeat the wiretap claim in such a seemingly offhand fashion.', 'Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said of Trump’s claim: “I’m not sure what it is he is talking about.', '“Perhaps the president has information that is not yet available to us or the public,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Nation.” If the allegation is true, “obviously we’re going to find out very quickly, and if it isn’t, then obviously he’ll have to explain what he meant by it.”', 'Democrats saw an effort by Trump to create a distraction from persistent questions about the Russian role in the campaign. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco called Trump the “deflector in chief.”', '“You make up something, then you have the press write about it, and then you say, ‘Everybody’s writing about this charge,’” she said, also on CNN. “It’s the tool of an authoritarian.”', 'Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump’s wiretapping claim baseless — but raised the possibility that looking into it could be a way to widen the door to a wider investigation of Russian involvement.', 'If the White House wanted answers to questions about alleged surveillance, Schiff said in a statement, Comey should be summoned to “answer any question put to him that is pertinent to the Russia investigation.”', 'Democrats also signaled they were not ready to let the Sessions’ statements drop despite his agreement to recuse himself from campaign-related investigations.

Nonresident students numbered 34,673 in fall 2016, 16.5% of the system’s 210,170 undergraduates.', ' The limit would be the first of its kind for the 10-campus public research university. But UC officials hope it will be enough to get state officials to release the funds.', 'A scathing state audit, which UC President Janet Napolitano blasted as unfair and unwarranted, found that UC was hurting California students by admitting too many out-of-state applicants.', 'UC spokeswoman Dianne Klein said the proposed policy balanced the needs of California students with the benefits those outside students bring — diverse perspectives as well as millions in additional tuition revenue, which added up to nearly $550 million in 2016-17. Those dollars have helped UC increase its enrollment of California students to historical highs this year, Klein said, even as state support per UC student has fallen to less than half of what it was two decades ago.', '"The policy is very clear: Nonresident students will be in addition to and not in place of California residents," Klein said. “But it accepts the reality that we need this money to help fund California undergraduates.…We can\'t rely on the state to supply the undergraduate funding we need to maintain the academic quality for California students.”', 'Faculty members are not enthusiastic, said UC Academic Senate Chairman James Chalfant. They oppose an “arbitrary quota,” he said, that could force UC to turn away the best and the brightest and forgo additional needed dollars. The group has presented an alternative that would impose enrollment limits only on campuses at which the expansion of nonresident students hurts Californians and only after UC is given enough funding to maintain its quality.', '“We do understand why this is happening,” Chalfant said. “But we’re disappointed because we think the conversation should be about how those [nonresident] revenues benefit all students, rather than some fixed number.”', 'But Shelly Tan, a Los Angeles area parent, said qualified California students should have the advantage. Her own child was turned down by her top three UC choices two years ago, despite SAT scores and a grade point average above the 90th percentile. Her daughter ended up at a fourth UC campus.', '“Given the economic climate and competition, California parents have to start being selfish,” Tan said. “We can’t stay all liberal and let everyone in.”', 'Under the proposal, which the UC Board of Regents will consider next week, the system’s three most popular campuses would be allowed to keep but not increase their proportions of nonresident undergraduates — 24.4% at UC Berkeley, 22.9% at UC San Diego and 22.8% at UCLA, Klein said.', 'The proportion of nonresident students at the other campuses ranges from 18.9% at UC Irvine to less than 1% at UC Merced. Those campuses each would be allowed to grow up to 20% so long as the systemwide limit was not exceeded, Klein said.', 'The policy would be reviewed at every five years at minimum, taking into account state support, Klein said.', 'It was not clear whether the proposal, if approved by regents, would satisfy state officials and trigger the release of the $18.5 million. Assemblyman Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento) proposed a bill last year that would have capped nonresident enrollment at current numbers, but the UC proposal allows for some continued growth.', '“It’s a mixed bag,” McCarty said of the UC proposal. “Finally, after all of these years, UC is on the verge of setting a firm nonresident policy that will help us prioritize California kids. But we were hoping the cap would be at today’s numbers. It’s close, but it falls a little short.”', "The state’s declining support led UC to quadruple its nonresident undergraduate population between 2007 and 2016. Even so, the UC's percentage of nonresident students   is lower than the average 27.9% for the 62 members of the elite Assn. of American Universities.", 'The population of California resident students increased by 10% during that time. UC hopes to enroll an additional 2,500 Californians this fall as part of an agreement with the state to add 10,000 more resident students by 2018.', 'Klein said the extra dollars from nonresidents — who pay about $27,000 more in annual tuition than Californians — have helped campuses recruit and retain faculty, add courses to lower overall class sizes, and purchase library materials, instructional equipment and technology. The nonresident revenue also has boosted financial aid for Californians by an average $700 per student, she said.', 'Competition for seats has been especially fierce at UCLA, which became the first university in the nation to receive more than 100,000 freshman applications for fall 2017. The Westwood campus tripled its nonresident undergraduates while reducing its California students by 4% between 2008 and 2015. UCLA added more than 1,000 Californians last fall, however.', 'UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said the nonresident dollars provided a lifeline for the campus after state support for undergraduate education dropped significantly after the 2008 recession. Thanks to the extra money, UCLA was able to add courses, which has helped students shorten the time needed to graduate to less than four years.', '“Financially it made a huge difference,” Block said. “We could not have managed these graduation rates without having the additional resources.”', 'Block and others stressed, however, that nonresident students are not simply cash cows. Danny Siegel, UCLA’s undergraduate student body president and a Long Beach native, said his friendship with a Chinese student helped him break out of his cultural comfort zone and got him to attend Lunar New Year events on campus this year. He said he also appreciates U.S. freedoms more after hearing his friend’s stories about China’s censorship of social media.', '“I’ve lived in an L.A. bubble my whole life so it’s great to hear perspectives from different places,” Siegel said.', 'His international friend, Jack Guo, said he cherishes the superior research and entrepreneurial opportunities in California — and hopes he has helped his UCLA classmates better understand China. “We don’t have to worry about being shot in the street,” he said he told students who were critical of China’s authoritarian government in a political science class.', 'Shane White, a UCLA School of Dentistry professor, recalled one international student who “catalyzed” a classroom discussion on pain control when she said her African town had no access to anesthesia during dental work. “It was a jaw-dropper for American kids — something that would never occur to them,” White said.', 'Susan Cochran, a professor of epidemiology and statistics who heads UCLA’s Academic Senate, said the “narrowness of being a Californian” was evident in her students’ overwhelming shock that Donald Trump won the presidency.', '“California is culturally so different than the rest of the country and our children growing up here think this is what the country is like,” she said. “The diversity of students from other states and countries really opens up the eyes for Californians.”', 'The proposal’s biggest boosters will likely be California families like the Uriartes of South Pasadena. Katherine Uriarte, the daughter of Mexican immigrants and the first in her family to attend college, aced six Advanced Placement exams, got high ACT scores and earned a slew of awards, including the prestigious Girl Scout Gold Award. But she was rejected by UCLA and UC Berkeley for fall 2015 admission.', 'Uriarte is more than happy at Columbia University, where she is a sophomore majoring in environmental biology.

Israel’s parliament has passed into law a controversial travel ban to keep out people who support boycotts of the country or the Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.', 'The legislation, which was backed by the ruling right-wing coalition, passed Monday by a vote of 48-26. It allows the government to block entry of non-residents who publicly call for a boycott or are associated with companies, advocacy groups or other organizations that do so.', 'The legislation defines a boycott to include all calls against Israel, its government, products, or settlements in territories under Israeli military control. The law gives Israel’s interior minister the authority to make exemptions in special circumstances. ', 'It describes boycott efforts as a “new front of war against Israel.” In recent years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have portrayed the pro-Palestinian movement known as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions as an anti-Semitic effort to isolate the country economically.', 'One of the law’s sponsors, parliament member David Amsalem of the ruling Likud Party, described the legislation as “basic.”', '“I’m not allowing anyone who humiliates me to come into my house,” he told the parliament. “We aren’t against legitimate criticism, but there’s no connection between that and to call for a boycott on the state of Israel, which is crossing a red line.’’', 'Opponents of the law warned that it would put Israel at loggerheads with international groups opposed to the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.', '“Who doesn’t call for a boycott of settlements today?’’ said Dov Khenin, a lawmaker from the predominantly Arab Joint List coalition.  “Look at the United Nations, the European Union, and what’s going on in the international community: Do you want to boycott all of them and prevent them from entering Israel?”', 'Americans for Peace Now, a pro-Israeli group opposed to the settlements, warned that the new law would be used to squelch dissenting voices.', '“This new draconian law is a severe blow to Israeli democracy,” said Chief Executive Debra DeLee in a statement. “It is aimed at basic  civil liberty, the freedom of expression, and it will severely harm Israel by keeping out some of its greatest supporters.”', 'Passage of the law follows two incidents in recent weeks in which Israeli immigration authorities put up roadblocks for representatives of human rights organizations trying to enter the country.', 'A San Francisco executive from the New Israel Fund was detained at the airport for 90 minutes after a grilling about the organization’s activities, and Human Rights Watch complained that a U.S. researcher was denied a work permit.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

If “Amy Schumer: The Leather Special” was as funny as it is dirty, it would be the next step in her drunken walk of shame toward world domination.', '“Every comic has one moment where they wear leather and they regret it,” says Schumer at the start of the special, dressed in a tight black leather bodysuit. “This is my moment.”', '“Don’t know if you guys know, this but this past year I’ve gotten very rich, famous and humble,” she said, and then mentions a revealing photo she tweeted: “Here’s a word that you don’t want to hear when a nude photo of you goes viral. Brave.”', 'But the one-hour stand-up set, which premieres Tuesday on Netflix, is mostly full of the unapologetic raunch that’s contributed to her success: detailed descriptions of her messy sex life, vivid references to her bodily functions and other aggressively TMI moments — none of which can be reprinted here.', 'Schumer’s renown for obliterating narrow ideas about female sexuality, double standards and negative body image with a crude and biting realism is usually reserved for men in comedy. And she does it with an abandon that’s often as boundary-smashing as it is obscenely funny.', '“The Leather Special” not only relies on many of those familiar and explicit themes, but kicks it all up a notch so there’s more of it — with more frequency and extremities. And as it turns out, that’s not a good thing. I’d put an example here, but a series of bleeped out words probably won’t be helpful.', 'Ironically, the dirtier it gets, the less daring it feels. Part of the problem is that she doesn’t drop in enough context from her life of late, and the material feels like it could have come from a set three years ago.', 'It’s ironic given how much Schumer’s circumstances have changed over the last few years. She’s now a famous comedian, the author of a bestselling book, star and writer of the film “Trainwreck” and the talent that drives Comedy Central’s series “Inside Amy Schumer.” The sketch show, which has completed four seasons, won a Peabody Award and Emmy last year for outstanding variety sketch series.', 'Schumer also made news last year during the election when Donald Trump supporters walked out of her Florida show after she called him an “orange, sexual-assaulting, fake-college-starting monster.” Beyoncé fans got mad about her mock “Formation” video. And viewers of her show wanted her to apologize when one of her male writers posted what were widely perceived as sexist comments on social media.', 'When Schumer does dial back on the pearl-clutching material, it breaks up the monotony. Her experience at the Peabody Awards is one such moment: “The other people there were like Ebola fighters, and Malala, and our show,” she says of the other finalists there and then proceeds to draw a contrast between her work and that of the young Pakastani activist Malala Yousafzai. ', '“At the beginning of the awards they showed a little clip of each person’s project. First they showed a clip of the Ebola fighters in [body] suits, where they go in and save lives. And then Malala, Malalaing. And then they show a clip of our show … me taking a giant bite of a burger, then going ‘I’m gonna make some room’ and walking to the toilet. … Malala being fitted for a glass eye, and then me….”', 'Mid-set, Schumer gets as serious as she ever does when she brings up two Louisiana women who were shot and killed in 2015 by an assailant who opened fire during a showing of “Trainwreck,” injuring nine other people and killing himself.', 'Schumer says she wanted to raise awareness so that mentally ill people were not able to buy guns, but “no matter what you say, as soon as you say the word gun, what gun nuts hear is ‘She wants to take all our guns! That shifty Jew wants our guns! Our amendment!’ … I found out if you’re on the terrorist watch list you can easily get a gun. So the same guy who is like, ‘Git out of our country, foreigner!’ is like, ‘But while you’re here, please enjoy our firearms, legally.’”', 'It’s tonally abrupt, but it does find her pushing what she and the audience are comfortable with.', 'Stronger still is when she mentions her failure to look and act like a celebrity. Schumer says and her sister, Kim, dress like they’re homeless, but the tabloids “still write about us as if we’re the Kardashian sisters [cops a fancy fashion reporter voice]: ‘The Schumer sisters stepped out today. Amy opted for performance fleece and a pleather jacket from Forever 21.’ … We are the most disappointing people to ever be photographed. It looks like were moving and ran out of bags so we were like ‘let’s just wear it all.’”', 'Schumer’s material on the base, everyday sex/guy/gross body image stuff is still funny, but as her life has gotten crazier and more surreal, it’s these new observations that push her set forward.', '‘Amy Schumer: The Leather Special’', 'Where: Netflix', 'When: Anytime starting, Tuesday', 'Rating: TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children under the age of 17)', 'The actor was a fan of the AMC show before joining it, so he\'d seen his favorite characters get killed off.

Jamie McBride, an outspoken leader of the union that represents Los Angeles Police Department officers, won $1.5 million Monday in a lawsuit alleging that his supervisors retaliated against him.', 'McBride alleged that he was unfairly punished for refusing to sign a declaration prepared by a federal prosecutor in a case involving 38th Street gang members.', 'One of the gang members charged in the case was McBride’s confidential informant. McBride thought the declaration was inaccurate because it did not reflect his role in encouraging the informant to get close to a Mexican Mafia leader.', 'Jurors awarded McBride, who said he suffers from hypothyroidism brought on by stress, $1 million for pain and suffering and another $500,000 for future pain and suffering.', '“It was an uphill battle for Jamie. Thank God for the jury system,” said McBride’s lawyer, Gregory Smith.', 'A spokesman for the L.A. city attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment.', 'The five-day trial in Los Angeles Superior Court featured testimony from two high-ranking LAPD officials: Asst. Chief Jorge Villegas and Deputy Chief Sean Malinowski. Both were among McBride’s supervisors at the time Malinowksi is now chief of staff for Chief Charlie Beck.', 'After the LAPD launched an investigation into McBride’s interactions with the informant, he was referred to a Board of Rights, a disciplinary panel that decides serious misconduct cases.', 'While waiting for his hearing, McBride was relieved of duty without pay for five months. In April 2014, the board found McBride guilty of failing to document his contacts with the informant and failing to properly train his subordinates on the use of confidential informants. He was suspended for 10 days without pay.', 'Villegas, who was then deputy chief of the Valley Bureau, later barred McBride from being a supervisor, working with confidential informants and taking a night watch job.', 'Villegas insisted he did not know McBride personally and was unaware of McBride’s refusal to sign the prosecutor’s declaration. McBride’s prior disciplinary history also played a part in Villegas’ decision.', 'But McBride alleged that Villegas retaliated against him for his refusal to sign the declaration, citing a detective who claimed to have overheard Villegas saying: “He didn’t sign it … he embarrassed us, and could have jeopardized the entire case.”', 'McBride was elected to the Los Angeles Police Protective League’s board of directors, which is a full-time job, two years ago. He lost a close race for union president last December.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and three other advocacy groups have gone to court to back Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell’s attempt to send prosecutors the names of deputies found to have committed serious misconduct on the job.', 'The move is the latest turn in the fight over a secret list of 300 problematic deputies whose history of misconduct could damage their credibility if they are ever called to testify in criminal cases.', 'The Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs has sued the department over the disclosure, saying it would violate peace officer confidentiality laws and draw unfair scrutiny on deputies whose mistakes might have happened long ago.', 'A Superior Court judge agreed in January that providing the list would violate state law, but said the department could turn over the names of problem deputies when there’s a pending case in which that officer might testify. Last month, a two-judge appellate court panel granted the union’s request to put a temporary hold on any transmission of names, even in pending cases.', 'The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday, asking the appeals court to reject the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs’ request that none of the names of problem deputies be sent to prosecutors.', '“Criminal trials are not games where the prosecution and law enforcement are permitted to withhold information that helps the defense,” Peter Eliasberg, chief counsel at the ACLU of Southern California, said in a news release.', '“It is essential to the right to a fair trial that the prosecutor inform the defense if there is potentially exculpatory or impeachment evidence in an officer’s personnel file, including conclusions by the department that an officer has filed a false report or lied on the witness stand,” he said.', 'An attorney for the union said she did not yet have time Monday to review the ACLU’s filing.', 'The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has collected the names of about 300 deputies who have a history of past misconduct —\xa0such as domestic violence, theft, bribery and brutality —\xa0that could damage their credibility if they testify in court.', 'Sheriff Jim McDonnell wants to send the names...', 'The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has collected the names of about 300 deputies who have a history of past misconduct —\xa0such as domestic violence, theft, bribery and brutality —\xa0that could damage their credibility if they testify in court.', 'Sheriff Jim McDonnell wants to send the names...', 'The department warned about 300 deputies in October that their personnel files contained evidence of “moral turpitude.” The letters said such acts could include accepting bribes or gifts, misappropriating property, tampering with evidence, lying, obstructing investigations, falsifying records, using unreasonable force, discriminatory harassment and family violence. Sheriff’s officials said it was possible that some of the offenses didn’t apply to any current deputies on the department.', 'The targeted group represents about 3% of the department’s roughly 9,100 deputies.', 'In the letters, the department said the list would include only deputies found guilty of wrongdoing by internal investigators. The agency would send just the deputies’ names, not their entire personnel files, the letters said.', 'Under the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brady vs. Maryland, prosecutors are obligated to alert defendants to any evidence that could aid the defense. That evidence includes information that could undermine an officer’s credibility. Not doing so could result in wrongful convictions.', 'The court battle over the list of sheriff’s deputies also comes as Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey is redefining how her office would handle the names of officers with histories of misconduct. Right now, the office doesn’t obtain lists of problem officers from police agencies, Lacey said in a recent interview.', ' ', 'In a perplexing wrinkle to the court action last month, one of her deputy district attorneys filed a declaration in the sheriff’s union’s favor stating that Lacey’s office “actively declines to accept information” from officer personnel files without the permission of the officer. But in last week’s interview with The Times, Lacey distanced herself from Deputy Dist. Atty. Jason Lustig’s declaration. ', '“I didn’t help with it. I didn’t know about it,” she said.', 'Elizabeth Gibbons, an attorney for the sheriffs association, said recently that she composed the declaration and had Lustig sign it. Lustig, who at the time oversaw the district attorney’s  unit that handles police misconduct evidence, now has been reassigned to the agency’s Long Beach branch, a move Lacey said has no connection to his involvement with the declaration.', 'Lacey’s office published a new policy last month that addresses how to handle certain types of police misconduct evidence. Lacey said the new policy allows police agencies to send her office the names of problem officers, but only if the police organization establishes its own rules surrounding the disclosure and seeks input from the relevant police union.', 'Asked whether the Los Angeles Police Department has expressed interest in formulating a policy in line with what Lacey has proposed, she responded, “I wouldn’t know.”', '“That’s up to them to take the initiative to develop their own policy,” she said.', 'LAPD internal affairs Cmdr. Stuart Maislin has previously said his agency is monitoring the legal dispute over the sheriff’s list and has not decided whether to send names of problem officers to prosecutors.', 'The ACLU’s brief was filed in conjunction with California Attorneys for Criminal Justice and the California Public Defenders Assn. — both of which support criminal defense lawyers — and Dignity and Power Now, a Los Angeles-based group that advocates on behalf of those who have been incarcerated in the Sheriff’s Department’s jail system. Dignity and Power Now has also started a petition asking the appeals court to allow the names of problem deputies to be sent to prosecutors.', 'There is no timeline set for when the appeals court is expected to make a decision.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

A quarter-cent sales tax increase in Los Angeles County to fund anti-homelessness measures appeared to earn  the two-thirds majority needed for passage early Wednesday, with 100% of county precincts reporting.', 'Measure H would generate about $355 million annually for homeless programs over 10 years, backers say. The tax increase would raise the sales tax rate to 9% across most of Los Angeles County and up to 10% in a few communities.', 'It would be the second phase of a two-step fundraising strategy developed by the city and county. Los Angeles city voters approved a $1.2-billion bond measure in November to provide supplemental funding for 10,000 units of permanent housing with support services for the chronically homeless.', 'The new sales tax revenue would pay for services attached to those units and provide rental subsidies and services for thousands more units across the county.', 'Around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, the L.A. County Registrar-Recorder reported that the yes vote stood at  67%, up from less than 63% early Tuesday night. It was just enough to squeak by the two-thirds majority needed for passage. ', 'On election night, Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson, Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson and county Supervisor Janice Hahn all said they were optimistic. ', '"Every new report that has been received since the first one is trending in the direction we want," said Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.', 'Earlier Tuesday evening, Hahn had said that if the sales tax increase failed she would try again on a future ballot.', '"Win or lose, I\'m going to have homelessness at the top of my priorities as a supervisor," said Hahn, who was elected to the board in November.', 'Advertising for the measure promised it would move an estimated 45,000 families and individuals from homelessness into permanent housing during the first five years, while preventing 30,000 more families and individuals from becoming homeless.', '“Measure H revenue will enable the most comprehensive plan to combat homelessness in the history of Los Angeles County,” said Phil Ansell, head of the county’s Homeless Initiative.', 'The complex and still-evolving spending plan includes rent to house thousands of people in existing apartments and services for those units, and an additional 10,000 units to be built over a decade with help from the homeless housing bond approved by Los Angeles city voters in November. ', 'County officials have outlined the basic strategies that would be funded, but they have not yet issued a budget showing the proportions each would receive. Those decisions would be sorted out by a panel of 50 people appointed from county government, cities and the nonprofit world, Ansell said. ', 'The panel would consider six main categories: subsidized housing, coordinated outreach and shelters, case management and services, homelessness prevention, income support and preservation of existing housing.', 'More than 250 business, nonprofit, labor, government and religious organizations endorsed Measure H, which faced no organized opposition.', 'A $3.5-million campaign received contributions from real estate and investment firms, labor organizations, philanthropists and other groups with ties to Los Angeles. Those donors include Disney Worldwide Services Inc., USC, former DreamWorks Animation Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and the Los Angeles Chargers. The campaign sent about 4 million mailers and advertised in Los Angeles County newspapers.', 'The county Board of Supervisors added $1 million for a campaign including television spots. ', 'United Way of Greater Los Angeles also committed $200,000 for community engagement activities in support of the measure.', 'Awaiting late returns, Hahn called Measure H “the most inspiring and moving campaign I\'ve ever been a part of,” adding that it was “about helping people most of us will never meet."', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti won reelection Tuesday in what appeared to be one of the biggest landslides in the city’s history, crushing 10 little-known rivals and strengthening his standing for a potential run for higher office.', 'With nearly half  the ballots counted, Garcetti was holding more than 80% of the vote.

In the closest council race, incumbent Gil Cedillo appeared early Wednesday to have avoided a runoff against challenger Joe Bray-Ali, receiving just under 51% of the votes with all precincts reporting.', 'In a season when Donald Trump’s tumultuous presidency has dominated politics worldwide, it has been hard for Garcetti and others on the L.A. ballot to capture the public’s attention.', 'Charter school backers had their first chance on Tuesday to win majority control of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but now that goal has been deferred, if it happens at all.', 'In the highest-profile contest, in District 4, charter partisans were unable, for now, to unseat two-term incumbent...', 'Charter school backers had their first chance on Tuesday to win majority control of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but now that goal has been deferred, if it happens at all.', 'In the highest-profile contest, in District 4, charter partisans were unable, for now, to unseat two-term incumbent...', 'Garcetti spent more than $3 million trying to burnish his image for an election he stood little chance of losing. His goal was to win not just another term, but also a solid affirmation of hometown support for a potential run for higher office.  He governs a city of nearly 4 million people, but is barely known outside Southern California.', 'In his campaign, Garcetti stressed his record raising the minimum wage, cutting business taxes and backing ballot measures to expand public transit and house the homeless.', 'The recent surge in homelessness and an uptick in crime threatened to dampen Garcetti’s support, even if he was widely expected to win the majority vote that he needs to avoid a May 16 runoff.', 'Public anxiety over explosive growth of development in Hollywood and other neighborhoods fueled support for Measure S, which would hinder some major real estate projects. Passage of the measure would have been a blow to the pro-development mayor, but it was losing by a wide margin Tuesday night.', 'Follow live updates on the L.A. primary election »', 'A liberal Democrat, Garcetti also faced criticism from immigrant rights advocates who accused him of failing to speak out forcefully enough against Trump, a charge he denied. They criticized him for resisting labeling Los Angeles a “sanctuary city” for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.', "On Tuesday night, scores of protesters gathered outside Garcetti's election celebration at the Pico-Union office of Laborers International Union of North America Local 300.", '"Sanctuary is our demand, Mayor Garcetti take a stand," they chanted.', 'Garcetti has sought to raise his national profile in recent weeks by denouncing Trump’s immigration policies in television news interviews.', '“He’s out there defending the cause,” Romario Ortiz, 27, the son of immigrants from Guatemala and El Salvador, said Tuesday after voting for Garcetti at an Echo Park polling station.', 'Only one of Garcetti’s challengers, Democratic political operative Mitchell Schwartz, posed at least a minimal threat. Schwartz spent nearly $700,000 on the contest, much of it for final-week mailings to voters. It has been many decades since that kind of small-scale campaign has succeeded in an L.A. mayor’s race.', 'The other two citywide elected officials, Controller Ron Galperin and City Atty. Mike Feuer, were running unopposed  Tuesday, as was Councilman Bob Blumenfield in the West Valley.', 'But Cedillo and City Councilmen Paul Koretz, Curren Price, Mike Bonin, Mitch O’Farrell and Joe Buscaino were all facing challengers. In the East Valley, 20 candidates were vying for the open council seat last held by Felipe Fuentes.', 'Cedillo, who served 14 years as a state lawmaker before winning his council seat four years ago, was facing one of the most serious challenges, from Bray-Ali, a bike activist. But the first round of election returns found that even Cedillo stood a chance of winning a majority and avoiding a runoff.', 'One sign of concern among Cedillo supporters was a late $80,000 expenditure by a Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce committee on Spanish-language radio ads promoting the Eastside councilman. The ads focused on his work supporting immigrants in the country illegally.', 'At Cedillo’s party Tuesday night in Highland Park, former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said a runoff looked unlikely.', '“He’s a fighter and I think the people recognize that,” said Villaraigosa, now a candidate for governor.', ' Price, one of three African Americans on the council, was trying to fend off two Latino challengers in his district just south of downtown. The district has become a test of black political power in recent years as the Latino population has steadily risen. Initial returns showed Price easily avoiding a runoff.', 'Koretz, Bonin, O’Farrell and Buscaino were each defeating their opponents handily in early returns. In the open East Valley district, early returns showed Karo Torossian and Monica Rodriguez best positioned to make a May runoff.', 'The trickle of voters at city polling stations captured the city’s prevailing attitude toward the election: indifference.', '“Four people in line at my polling place is four more people than I thought would be at my polling place, so that’s something,” USC graduate student Alex Amadeo wrote on Twitter.', 'The city’s elected officials normally serve four-year terms. But because of a shift in the election calendar, winners of this year’s elections will serve 5½ years.

While the early campaign finance filings in the race for the 34th Congressional District give an incomplete picture, they’re also a glimpse into who the powerhouse fundraisers could be and where some local power brokers are placing their bets in a crowded field of 23 candidates.', 'Many of the candidates hoping to replace Xavier Becerra to represent Los Angeles hadn’t even entered the race by Dec. 31, the last day covered by the most recent reports, and the next round of reports won’t be filed until 10 days before the April 4 special election.', 'Here’s some of what we’ve learned so far from the small group of candidates who reported raising money before the December deadline:', 'Many have assumed that Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), who’s received dozens of endorsements from Democratic elected officials and party leaders, including Becerra himself, is the person to beat. In early fundraising totals, at least, that’s true.', 'Gomez topped fundraising totals for the field, bringing in $301,493 and ending the year with $292,935 cash on hand. The fact that he was able to raise a six-figure sum so quickly after joining the race Dec. 5 means lesser-known candidates could struggle to get their message out as widely.', 'Sara Hernandez, a former aide to L.A. Councilman Jose Huizar, also raised a substantial sum, with $200,232 in contributions over the roughly two-week period after she jumped in the race. She ended the year with $194,214 in the bank.', 'While the other candidates are considerably behind — Alejandra Campoverdi was the closest with $106,304 in contributions — that picture could change quickly over the next several weeks as campaigning and fundraising get more rigorous.', 'If the early figures are any indication, top dogs in L.A.’s political and entertainment scene aren’t sitting out the race for this rare open seat.', 'Gil Garcetti and Amy Wakeland, the father and wife of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, have given money to Gomez, who has also received Garcetti’s endorsement. L.A. City Councilman Bob Blumenfield also contributed to Gomez, as did former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, who represented Los Angeles in the Legislature.', 'Former L.A. Times publisher Austin Beutner gave a maximum contribution of $2,700 to Wendy Carrillo, while Renata Simril, a former senior vice president for The Times who now heads the LA84 Foundation, gave $1,000 to Gomez.', 'Yolie Flores received contributions from top education leaders, including $1,000 from former LAUSD Supt. John Deasy and $500 from Katie Braude, who sits on the L.A. County Board of Education. Marcia Aaron, the founder and CEO of KIPP LA charter schools, also gave Flores $500.', 'Carrillo also received maximum contributions from syndicated hip-hop radio host Kurt “Big Boy” Alexander and progressive activist Alida Garcia. Hernandez collected $1,000 from former record label executive Mo Ostin and $2,700 each from prominent Arts District developer Howard Klein, his son and his wife.', 'Arturo Carmona’s $93,164 fundraising total includes $25,000 in money he loaned himself.', 'Gomez gave his campaign $5,400, the combined maximum for individual contributions in the primary and potential runoff elections, while Hernandez contributed $5,096 to her campaign and Flores gave $1,000 to her effort.', 'Raymond Meza also contributed $2,700 toward his own run.', 'Gomez was the only candidate to raise money from political committees — he got a boost to the tune of $38,900 from those groups. Many included campaign committees for his Assembly colleagues, including Democrats Ian Calderon, Marc Levine and Blanca Rubio.', 'Gomez also received a total of $3,750 from at least five California registered lobbyists, who are barred from giving money to his Assembly campaign account by state law.', 'Less than 20% of the money that poured into the race as of Dec. 31 was from out of state, according to FEC records. About $590,087 of all contributions — excluding money candidates gave to themselves and small unitemized contributions — came from California.', 'Hernandez and Gomez were the big winners. Hernandez raised $167,046 from California residents. In-state donations to the Gomez campaign were $244,115.', 'Campoverdi and Flores, at 56% and 65% respectively, raised the least from in-state donors as a share of their total.', 'Gomez, who raised the largest amount of California cash, and Campoverdi, a former White House aide and former L.A. Times employee, raised substantial sums from Washington, D.C., and New York.', 'All told, individuals and political committees associated with the consulting, real estate, legal and financial services industries raised $312,805 for the candidates in the 34th Congressional District, according to an analysis by The Times.', 'Gomez received more than a quarter of his itemized campaign contributions from the consulting category, and other top categories for the assemblyman included healthcare, legal and government professions.', 'Hernandez raised large amounts from real estate professionals as well as the financial services and legal sectors, while Campoverdi’s top contributions came from the consulting, entertainment and financial services fields.', "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan\xa0addressed the House of Representatives after Wednesday's shooting at a practice of lawmakers for the annual charity congressional baseball game.", 'Sen.

Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) is still awaiting confirmation as California’s next attorney general, and there’s no date set for an election to replace him, but that hasn’t stopped the furious pace of palace intrigue.', 'The names of more than a dozen potential candidates to replace Becerra in Los Angeles’ 34th Congressional District have been floated since Dec. 1, when\xa0Gov. Jerry Brown named him as his\xa0chosen successor to Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, California’s newest U.S. senator.', 'One of the most well-connected possible replacements, former Assembly Speaker John A. Pérez, withdrew from consideration\xa0Dec. 10 due to unspecified health reasons, saying that his\xa0treatment “doesn’t lend itself to the intensity of a campaign that the community deserves.”', 'Pérez, who ran unsuccessfully for state controller in 2014, had already received dozens of endorsements from members of the state Democratic Party\xa0when he dropped out, scrambling the race.', 'SIGN UP for our free Essential Politics newsletter &gt&gt', 'With Pérez out, Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), a former labor organizer who was elected to the\xa0Legislature in 2012, appears to have begun consolidating\xa0support from the state’s Democratic establishment. Gomez announced\xa0the endorsements of Los Angeles\xa0Mayor Eric Garcetti, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) in quick succession after Perez dropped out.', 'Gomez said in a statement announcing his run that he wants to “make sure that the Trump Republican Party does not have a free hand in Washington.”', 'At least 16\xa0other candidates have said they would run for the seat. They include\xa0Wendy Carrillo, a local labor activist and former journalist who was brought to the United States illegally from El Salvador as a child\xa0Kenneth Mejia, a Green Party candidate and self-proclaimed “Berniecrat” who previously ran against Becerra in the June election Sara Hernandez, a former aide to L.A. City Councilman Jose Huizar who most recently ran public affairs institute Coro Southern California Arturo Carmona, a former deputy political director for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign and\xa0Yolie Flores, a former LAUSD board member.', 'Also running are Karl Siganporia, a Republican living in the Bay Area\xa0Raymond Meza, a union organizer who helped coordinate the “Fight for $15” campaign to raise the minimum wage Alejandra Campoverdi, a former White House aide who worked briefly for the Los Angeles Times\xa0Steven Mac, an L.A. County prosecutor and former Army intelligence officer\xa0Vanessa Aramayo, former head of an anti-poverty group\xa0and Maria Cabildo, a former L.A. city planning commissioner.', 'William Rodriguez Morrison, a Republican and perennial candidate who most recently announced a run for L.A. mayor, and Tenaya Wallace, a Democrat and public relations consultant, have also said they are running but have not raised any money. Other recent candidates to join the fray are Sandra Mendoza, who ran for state Assembly in 2014, data analyst Alex Poulton and L.A. city planning commissioner Robert Lee Ahn, all Democrats.\xa0', 'In a statement announcing her run, Hernandez said she had raised more than $150,000 and that she knows “how to deal with bullies,” vowing\xa0to stand up to a Trump administration.', 'They\xa0and others who are still mulling over\xa0potential bids\xa0represent a younger generation of local activists eager to run in a race where the rapidly changing neighborhoods of downtown Los Angeles, Eagle Rock and Highland Park will send a new face to Congress for the first time in more than 20 years.', 'The race comes at a time when California’s statewide and congressional Democrats have vowed to be a thorn in the side of Donald Trump.', '“This can’t just be the usual game of musical chairs where one elected [official] moves to another position,” Hernandez said in an interview.\xa0“It’s time to turn this ship around, and that needs to be done by investing in a new generation of leadership that has the time and the energy and the fortitude to stand up to these challenges.”', 'The election of Donald Trump has also prompted several more seasoned politicians to skip the race: De León said he would not run, focusing instead on working with Becerra to “defend California’s progress.” L.A. City Councilmen Jose Huizar, who has been a vocal supporter of downtown development, and Gil Cedillo also turned down the opportunity, with Cedillo vowing to “stay and fight” for immigrant rights and other crucial issues in Los Angeles.\xa0', 'David Ryu, another councilman\xa0who last year cruised to victory with major support from the Korean community, also briefly considered vying for Becerra’s seat, but decided against it.', 'But there’s still time for the roster of candidates to expand: Brown can’t set an election date until Becerra resigns and creates a vacancy, something he has said he won’t do until after he’s confirmed by the Legislature.

Measure H rebounded from an early deficit to reach two-thirds majority.', 'Measure S was defeated after a heated battle over the future of L.A. development. Measure H rebounded from an early deficit to reach two-thirds majority.', 'Labor and business leaders declared victory Tuesday night over a bitterly contested ballot measure that would have imposed new restrictions on building apartment towers, shops and offices in Los Angeles.', 'As of midnight,  returns showed Measure S going down to defeat by a 2-1 margin, with more than half  of precincts reporting.', "“Defeating Measure S has spared our city from a future that would've meant fewer jobs, fewer funds for critical public services, fewer new homes for those who desperately need them, and even less affordable rents,” said Rusty Hicks, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. ", 'The Yes on S campaign said it had already prodded the city toward key reforms, but faced stiff opposition from powerful interests at City Hall. “We were up against the establishment,” campaign spokeswoman Ileana Wachtel said. “It’s tough to fight the status quo and it’s tough to fight really wealthy developers.”', 'Neighborhood activists had championed Measure S as a way to reform a broken planning process at City Hall, arguing that it would prevent out-of-scale projects that ramp up traffic and fuel gentrification.', 'But opponents — including labor unions, business groups and Mayor Eric Garcetti — warned it could eliminate jobs and exacerbate the housing crisis, throwing the city into economic turmoil. ', 'The divisive campaign doubled as a referendum on urbanist dreams of a denser, taller Los Angeles, bemoaned by critics as the “Manhattanization” of L.A. ', 'More than $13 million was poured into the fight, funding billboards, television ads and an avalanche of campaign mailers.', 'The Yes on S campaign raised more than $5 million — about 99% of which came from the nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation — to promote the ballot measure.', 'It was outspent by real estate developers, labor unions and other opponents who shelled out more than $8 million to try to stop it, including more than $3 million from a development company at odds with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation over a Hollywood project.', 'AIDS Healthcare Foundation executive Michael Weinstein said Tuesday  that the Yes on S campaign was the opening gambit on a larger fight against the entrenched powers in L.A. — wealthy developers and City Hall.', '“This campaign will go down in the record books as one of the most successful campaigns that did not actually win the vote,” Weinstein said.', 'As the battle over Measure S raged this year, local lawmakers hustled to speed up updates to community plans that guide neighborhood development. Garcetti pledged last fall that he would ban private meetings between developers and planning commissioners, part of an attempt to persuade Weinstein to abandon the controversial ballot measure.', '“We are going to hold City Hall’s feet to the fire on these issues,” Weinstein said.', 'Measure S targeted the long-standing practice of changing city rules to permit buildings that are taller or denser than the established restrictions would ordinarily allow.', 'It would have imposed a moratorium lasting up to two years on building projects that require zone changes and other alterations in city rules. It also targeted the controversial practice of “spot zoning” by barring Los Angeles officials from amending the General Plan — a document that governs development across the city — to make way for individual projects in areas they would otherwise be banned.', 'But the campaign was hardly a dry debate between planning wonks.', 'At news conferences and rallies, the Yes on S campaign railed against City Hall corruption, the eviction of poor tenants, rising homelessness and the health threats to children living along freeways.', 'Campaign director Jill Stewart argued that the city has been deviled by a “pay-to-play” culture in which politicians agree to rewrite zoning rules for real estate developers who sink money into their campaigns.', '“When people like me bought their home they didn’t think there would be a skyscraper next door to them ... because zoning was supposed to protect them,” said Carole Miller, a Mid-Wilshire homeowner who supported the ballot measure. “City Council has been taking all this money from developers and everybody knows it.”', 'Opponents accused the campaign of deceptive and irresponsible tactics, frequently complaining that it was assailing problems that the ballot measure would do little to stop.', 'For instance, when the Yes on S campaign staged a news conference with veterans and sent out mailers that urged, “House Our Vets,” its critics said it would do nothing to help homeless veterans. ', 'Garcetti, a staunch opponent of the measure, lamented that the Yes on S campaign had nonetheless plastered his smiling face on its mailers. And the Sheriff’s Department demanded that it stop sending out campaign mailers that mimicked eviction notices, saying they were misleading and illegal.', 'Much of the debate revolved around whether Measure S would help or hurt tenants as rents continue to soar. Backers of the ballot measure argued that it would combat luxury towers that were displacing longtime renters.', 'Opponents countered it would squelch housing production and accelerate evictions by blocking development on land that isn’t zoned for housing. ', 'The election results “seem to indicate that people understood the devastating impact that Measure S would have on our community if it passed,” said Gary Toebben, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce', 'Los Angeles voters also weighed in Tuesday on how to regulate marijuana: A ballot measure that would allow Los Angeles to tax and license commercial cannabis shops was leading by a hefty margin Tuesday night. A competing measure that was later abandoned by its proponents was trailing.', 'Another local measure that would allow longer leases for property at the Port of Los Angeles, championed by City Councilman Joe Buscaino as a way to help revitalize the waterfront, also appeared headed for victory.', 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.

Charter school backers had their first chance on Tuesday to win majority control of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but now that goal has been deferred, if it happens at all.', 'In the highest-profile contest, in District 4, charter partisans were unable, for now, to unseat two-term incumbent and board President Steve Zimmer, who finished on top with 47% of the vote, according to unofficial final returns.', 'Because he did not win a majority, Zimmer still will face a May runoff against second-place finisher Nick Melvoin, who had 31% of the vote in a field of four.', 'Also in a runoff is charter-backed Kelly Gonez, who finished in front of a field of six, with 36% of the vote, in District 6. She’ll face Imelda Padilla, who, like Zimmer, was financially supported by the teachers union, United Teachers Los Angeles. ', 'But charter backers did have one victory to celebrate. Incumbent Monica Garcia, an ally, cruised to victory in District 2, with 58% of vote. ', 'Tuesday’s races marked the latest battle between supporters of charter schools and those allied with the teachers union. Those two factions spent millions of dollars on outside campaigns that dominated the election.', 'Looking ahead to the runoff, Zimmer said he hoped that voters understood what’s at stake.', '“Voters have a stark choice,” he said, “between whether we can make more dreams come true for kids through working together with our teachers and parents or whether we’re going to return to the politics of conflict, competition and confrontation.”', 'Melvoin said a win for his side would represent new thinking and opportunity.', '“I want to change the paradigm of the school district from a bureaucratic school system to an innovative ecosystem of public schools,” Melvoin said. “The district hasn’t adapted to a reality of innovation. They see it as a threat, but it doesn’t have to be.”', 'The noise of the campaigns often obscured the competing visions of reform. Zimmer and his allies described a school system making progress, which would benefit from stability while expanding successful programs, graduating more students and enhancing social services to families.', 'Charter allies backing Melvoin — and also Allison Holdorff Polhill, who finished third in District 4 — included civic leaders who want a major shake-up, which starts but doesn’t end with charter schools.', 'The last time this faction was in power, from 2011 to 2014 under then-Supt. John Deasy, it pushed to close or restaff low-performing, district-operated schools, end seniority protections for teachers and make standardized test scores a substantial part of teacher evaluations.', 'The district’s subsequent leadership, including Supt. Michelle King, moved away from Deasy’s priorities.', 'Charter advocates hoped to emerge with three victors who could form a four-vote majority with board member and charter school founder Ref Rodriguez. That milestone gain remains possible, pending the outcome of balloting in May.', 'Charters are privately managed public schools that are exempt from some rules that govern traditional campuses. Most are nonunion. L.A. has more charters than any other school system does charter students make up about 16% of enrollment.', 'As election day began, charter backers liked their chances because they had endorsed competitive candidates and could count on seemingly unlimited financial resources from wealthy donors and support from the growing number of charter families.', 'But a major unknown was whether this core would turn out in greater numbers than supporters of the teachers union', 'Also unknown was the impact of a fiercely negative campaign in District 4, which covers the Westside and portions of the west San Fernando Valley. The union and its supporters tried to make voters see Melvoin and Holdorff Polhill as puppets of President Trump and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who favor government support for many kinds of school choice, including charters and religious schools. Charter school advocates blamed Zimmer for an array of the school district’s past and current ills.', 'Garcia won charter backers’ support, despite the fact that she has been making decisions on the board longer than Zimmer has.', 'Garcia, who surged ahead of two challengers Tuesday, has a sturdy political base in a district that covers downtown and adjacent neighborhoods. And she faced no challenge from a perennial foe, the teachers union, which conserved its resources for the other contests.', 'Garcia said her goals as a board member — a 100% graduation rate and all students qualified to enter college — have resonated with the striving, low-income community she represents and grew up in.', '"I think our movement gets stronger each election," she said during a gathering at Puente Learning Center in Boyle Heights, which featured a mariachi band from Mendez High School and an arch of blue, white and gold balloons. “There are a lot of folks who want to see an LAUSD that serves more kids well.”', 'In that contest, longtime Eastside teacher Lisa Alva came in second with 32% and parent activist Carl J. Petersen was third with 10%.', '"Either way, I win,” Alva said early Tuesday evening. “If I win, I win. If I don\'t win the election, I get to go back to the classroom."', 'District 6, in the east San Fernando Valley, came down to a face-off, at least in financial resources, between Gonez, a charter school science teacher, and Padilla, a community organizer.', 'Charter school backers, hoping for an outright win, ran a positive campaign for Gonez, along with negative campaigns targeting Padilla and Patty Lopez, a former state Assembly member who also was on the ballot. Lopez finished third with 13% of the vote.', 'Provisional ballots have yet to be counted, so the final percentages for each candidate could move up or down, but the outcomes are unlikely to change given the margins between candidates.', 'Those who win seats on the board face serious challenges. State laws are friendly to charter growth, so their numbers are expected to grow. When they siphon off more students, L.A. Unified loses funding based on enrollment, threatening its financial stability. A pro-charter board still would have to balance the district budget.', '“It’s one thing to be a reformer on the outside, but I don’t think any of them would want to be on the board when the system collapses and they would be responsible,” said Pedro Noguera, a professor at UCLA’s Graduate School of Education and Information Sciences. “They will have to be much more creative than simply authorizing more charter schools.”', 'Times staff writers Joy Resmovits, Sonali Kohli and Anna M.

California and New York become the latest states to consider single-payer health insurance systems as Congressional Republicans prioritize repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.', 'California and New York become the latest states to consider single-payer health insurance systems as Congressional Republicans prioritize repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.', 'Voters want politicians to be bold. They disrespect timidity. And trying to push every Californian into a government-run healthcare system is certifiably bold.', 'The voters’ desire for boldness has a caveat, of course: They’ve got to like what the politician is being bold about.', 'We really don’t know how Californians feel about government-run universal healthcare. People haven’t been asked for a while.', 'The Public Policy Institute of California surveyed voters in January, however, and found that 54% opposed congressional repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.', 'But for generations, it has been the dream of many — mostly Democrats — to enact whatever you want to call it: “single-payer,” “Medicare-for-all” or “socialized medicine.”', 'Now, with congressional Republicans and President Trump trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, some Sacramento Democrats think they see an opening to finally adopt a California version of single-payer.', 'Could California have its own single-payer health insurance system providing coverage for all residents? A bill has been introduced in the state Legislature that would do just that — and its chances of success could be vastly improved by President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress.', 'Thanks,...', 'Could California have its own single-payer health insurance system providing coverage for all residents? A bill has been introduced in the state Legislature that would do just that — and its chances of success could be vastly improved by President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress.', 'Thanks,...', 'Under single-payer, healthcare costs are paid for by the government, rather than by private insurance. The healthcare itself is still delivered by private physicians.', 'Some version that would allow people to buy supplemental private insurance — call it “Medicare-for-all” — presumably could fit into the system these Democrats envision.', 'We really don’t know because they haven’t actually proposed anything. They’re promising details in two weeks. So far, they’ve just tucked the concept of single-payer into an essentially hollow bill, SB 562, by Sens. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and Toni Atkins (D-San Diego).', 'The bill merely declares: “It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a comprehensive universal single-payer healthcare coverage program and a healthcare cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state.”', 'Yes, that means “all” — whether they’re in the country legally or not.', 'Medi-Cal, the state’s enhanced version of federal Medicaid for poor people, already covers children here illegally. But not their parents.', 'Lara told me that he mentioned to one kid that the Legislature had extended Medi-Cal to undocumented children.', '“He said, ‘Thank you senator, but what about my mom?’” Lara recalled. “What about my dad? How do we get to healthcare for everyone?’”', 'With great difficulty, I’d say. And the same for enacting any single-payer system.', 'Dreams can be good. But this dream — especially with Trump and conservative Republicans controlling the national agenda — seems like wishful fantasy, even in deep blue California.', 'The envisioned policy long has made sense. Cut out the insurance industry profiteering and reduce healthcare costs. Perhaps eliminate co-pays and deductibles, as Lara wants to do.', 'Even Medicare-for-all would be better than what most people have today. Ever hear a senior seriously complain about Medicare? I haven’t.', 'Most industrialized nations have some sort of government-run healthcare coverage — either single-payer or a hybrid public-private system.', 'But good policy aside, there are two huge obstacles to a state going solo: financing and politics.', 'In California, it would cost the state tens of billions of dollars. Who’d pay for that? Business, which presumably would no longer need to provide employees with health insurance? Wage earners through payroll withholding? Medical providers? How much would the federal government kick in? Anything?', 'That presumably will be in the bill’s details. Good luck.', 'And how would this legislation ever get passed? The politics are daunting. The insurance industry would fight with all it has — meaning campaign money. So would many healthcare providers that historically have feared “socialized medicine.”', 'On the other side, the California Nurses Assn. is the bill’s chief sponsor. And that labor union has influence among liberals.', 'But nothing of this magnitude and controversy can pass the Legislature without a committed governor pushing strongly. And Gov. Jerry Brown hasn’t said a peep about single-payer healthcare since he was elected in 2010. Moreover, the normally cautious skinflint is not likely to commit the state to such a financial gamble.', 'No other state has a single-payer plan. Vermont did briefly, but scrubbed it in 2014 because of high costs and unpopular taxes.', 'The California Legislature passed a single-payer bill — sort of — when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, but he vetoed it.', 'Actually, it wasn’t a real single-payer plan anyway. It didn’t include any financing. That was to be passed later and required a two-thirds supermajority vote. No way.', 'Updates from Sacramento »', 'Democrats currently hold a supermajority in each house. But you can bet not all are inclined to vote for a tax increase. Possibly for highway repairs, but not for an untested, radical change in healthcare coverage.', '“The time is right, the time is now,” insists Lara, who’s thinking about running for state insurance commissioner next year. “California can be the national laboratory for our country.”', '“What everyone agrees on,” he adds, “is we need to have an alternative” to threatened Obamacare.', 'But many Democrats believe their best hope is congressional gridlock and the blockage of repeal.', '“Perhaps I’m like Alice in Wonderland, but I really am hopeful,” says state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), the Budget Committee chairwoman. “There’s an amazing groundswell of people showing up all over the country fighting to retain the Affordable Care Act.”', 'What about single-payer? “I honestly don’t know.”', 'Not a lot of enthusiasm there.', 'She sounds like other Democrats who privately believe the focus should be on preserving what they can of Obamacare, which has pumped nearly $24 billion annually into California healthcare and halved the number of uninsured.', 'Bold is good. And it’s good some people are promoting universal healthcare.

A twin suicide bombing struck a village wedding north of Baghdad as the wedding party gathered in the evening hours, killing at least 26 people and wounding dozens, a government spokesman said Thursday.', 'The attack, which took place late Wednesday, began when one suicide bomber wearing an explosives-laden belt walked into the wedding party assembled in an open area in Hajaj, near the city of Tikrit, about 80 miles from Baghdad.', 'The bomber detonated his explosives, only to be followed by the second attacker who blew himself up when people had gathered to help the victims of the first explosion, provincial spokesman Ali Hamdani told the Associated Press. He said 26 people were killed, most of them children, and up to 67 were wounded.', 'There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on Islamic State, which has staged similar attacks in the past. The wedding party was for a family that had been displaced from Iraq\'s western Anbar province and that is affiliated with a major anti-Islamic State tribe there.', "Islamic State had captured Tikrit during its blitz across Iraq in the summer of 2014 when the Sunni militant group seized nearly a third of the country's territory. Iraqi forces drove the militants from the city in April 2015, but Islamic State has since then managed to launch deadly attacks in and around Tikrit.", "Islamic State has also used large-scale attacks in an effort to distract from its losses as Iraqi forces battle to retake all of Mosul, the country's second-largest city, from the group.", "Iraqi forces in Mosul have over the past week fought their way into the heart of the western part of the city, separated by the Tigris River from the eastern sector, capturing a government complex and the city's antiquities museum where Islamic State had destroyed priceless relics.", "Mosul fell to Islamic State in the summer of 2014, along with Tikrit and large swaths of northern and western Iraq, but now remains the militant group's last significant urban area in the country.", 'The LAPD suspended cadet training programs at stations where three teens are accused of stealing police cars.
