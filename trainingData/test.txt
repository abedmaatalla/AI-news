 one of the interesting things about becoming a parent is that your home is no longer your own . things disappear from drawers , mysteriously topple off shelves , and somehow wind up in the toilet . you learn which strange sounds need immediate attention and which can be safely ignored . and the mess . oh , the mess . it blooms like mushrooms after a rainstorm , appearing out of nowhere , spreading suddenly across rooms that just an hour ago where spotless . i have two boys under the age of three , and in the fall of this year my will to fight against the endless tide of clutter started to fade . i began just tidying up the surface mess , sure , but underneath , a steady layer of deep debris was accumulating . i needed reinforcements , warriors who wouldn t flag in the face of such a ceaseless foe . so i brought in a new breed of cleaning soldier , the robotic vacuum . i had resisted these gadgets for years , assuming that they wouldn t be able to really handle the work , and in fact might create more headaches than they saved . and the cheaper unit i tested confirmed those fears . it wandered around the house like a drunken sailor , going over the same areas needlessly , missing others , and getting hopelessly snagged on the smallest of obstacles . but the higher end units impressed me with their intelligence and autonomy . and my sons , who were of course curious about the robot , have grown fond of the new beings that roll , beep , and suction their way around our home . there is a mind boggling variety of robotic vacuum cleaners on the market . you can get units that specialize in wood flooring , carpet , or tile units that will wet mop your home and units that are customized to pick up pet hair . for this story , we looked at the new offerings from the biggest brands with basic cleaning capabilities the ampnbsproomba , ampnbspdeebot , and ampnbspneato botvac connected . they ranged in price from to , and the gap in cost showed in their performance . a cheap bot proved hopeless and frustrating let s start with the deebot , the cheapest of the units we tested . it can t see the world around it , so it relies on touch , bouncing off objects and adjusting accordingly . using it is a supremely frustrating experience . the deebot frequently goes over the same areas multiple times , takes extremely inefficient paths , and gets stuck in corners and on carpet . it s not representative of the brand overall deebot has more expensive units that can connect to wi fi and empty their own bins but it certainly speaks to what you get when buying a cheaper robot that has a limited ability to sense its surroundings . when you jump up to the neato connected botvac , the difference is clear . it still bumps into things as it moves around , but far less often . it uses laser scanning to map the space around it and then sweeps the floor in a smart , methodical pattern . it even circles around tricky areas like couch legs . it did miss corners , and struggled to find its way back to its charging station , but at a basic level it got the job done well . able to return home and recharge itself the next step up is the roomba , the most expensive and sophisticated unit we tested . it has a camera and floor sensor to track its location and avoid obstacles . i found that it was incredibly good at navigating my home and working its way into nooks and crannies . and when it needed a charge , the was always able to work its way back to the dock and connect , something the neato did often , but not always . all of these units had one major problem , which was that in a house as messy as mine , they filled up their trays after just a room or two , and while the roomba and neato can recharge on their own , you have to empty their trays by hand before they can get back to work . all promise to have the power and space to clean an entire apartment . but to make that happen , you need to religiously run them everyday , keeping the overall level of dirt down to a manageable level . adding wifi makes a world of difference luckily the newest neato and the roomba we tested are both wi fi enabled , and can be controlled remotely by an app . this makes it far easier to program routine cleaning set a schedule and just let the robot run once a day . or if you prefer , start it when you remember , either in person , or with a few taps on your phone . the ability to connect to wi fi is what really sets these units apart from their predecessors , like the roomba , which i also tested . if you re at work and the neato gets stuck , for example , it will send you an alert . you can switch to manual control and help to guide it off the obstacle so it can get back to work . as you can see in the video above , two kids means a ton of clutter . both the roomba and neato were able to work over and around most toys , although even they got snagged on the occasional toothbrush . overall i found the roomba struggled less with tangles in its brush , an issue that caused my neato to stop working several times , and which requires you to be on hand to manually fix . the roomba comes with an invisible fence the neato came with a magnetic strip which you could use to keep it from going past a certain point . the roomba , on the other hand , came with two battery powered towers that could cordon off a certain area , either with a straight line or a halo with a roughly foot diameter . this was really helpful if i wanted to simply push all the toys in a pile and then have my roomba clean around that . in my testing , the deebot is a waste of time for any home which doesn t have very simple , flat surfaces . by comparison the roomba was clearly the best overall , both in terms of its cleaning power and its ability to operate autonomously . the neato , which is cheaper than the roomba , is , in my opinion , the best deal , offering a solid if not quite superlative clean . not quite the jetsons , but getting closeryou shouldn t consider this a comprehensive review of the category , however , which is simply too vast and diverse to cover without many more months of testing . think of this as an introduction , with more reviews and comparisons to come . we haven t quite reached the jetson era miracle of a completely autonomous robot that can clean your whole house , but these little gizmos are getting extremely sophisticated . the technology on the market today , especially for a busy parent , is a huge asset in the daily battle against clutter and chaos . 	 the american public is becoming less religious and less likely to attend church than in decades past , according to research like the ampnbsppew study released last month . but for christians looking to spread the faith , there s been a recent bright spot apps that can put the bible in the pockets of millions , plus open the door for new and potentially more habitual forms of prayer and meditation . jesus met people where they were at and then drew them really deep into understanding the truth of god , said neil ahlsten , who left google last year to found the app abide . we re creating liturgy that people can consume whenever and wherever and however works for them . it fits the modern life . ahlsten has heard from many users who check abide in bed first thing in the morning and right before they go to sleep as many secular people do with their phones . christians have been praying at morning and night for millennia , but it turns out the tradition fits comfortably with habitual smartphone use . jesus met people where they were . youversion was one of the first christian apps and remains one of the most popular and one of the most popular apps , period but it almost didn t make it into the app store . before it was an app , youversion lived online as a website created to help people better engage with the bible , said bobby gruenewald , the app s founder . the site was on the verge of being shut down in , when an early mobile version saw a spike in traffic with the adoption of smartphones . the team behind youversion put together an app for the app store launch , and it had over , downloads the first day alone . since then , it has been downloaded nearly million times and consistently lands in the top charts section of the app store . it s not always practical to carry a print bible in my purse , said nish weiseth , a christian author and speaker . it s usually stuffed , so throwing in a bible is just one more thing to dig out . i m on my phone a lot throughout the day anyway , so having the entire bible readily available to read on my phone is really handy when i m out and about . this refrain was common among people talking about their devotional apps they re convenient . just as most of us no longer get our news from the delivery boy , those who read the bible are opening an app rather than carrying the physical thing . a screenshot from abide . phones also enable forms of devotion beyond simply reading a digital version of the bible . want to get daily texts from jesus ? there s an app for that . your daily bible reading can be delivered to your inbox , and if the faithful don t feel like leaving home on sunday mornings , they can stream church services from one of dozens of apps . confession guides users through the appropriate prayers of penitence for the sacrament of confession prayer notebook lets users sync their prayers across devices and neu bible is a minimalist take on the holy book for the design minded . full disclosure my father , who is a pastor , has consulted on the development of a religious app called soulpulse . behind a number of these apps is the christian concept of spiritual formation , the idea that if we undertake certain practices or disciplines , christians can become more , well , christian kinder , gentler , more full of joy , and so on . books and bible studies have been written with this goal in mind for centuries , but now spiritual formation efforts have moved online and into the app store . some , like that texts from jesus app , appear to be just another flashy version of religious kitsch , like an app ified footprints poem . but others seek to use the ubiquity of personal devices as an opportunity to encourage spiritual growth . some appear to be just another version of religious kitsch , like an app ified footprints poemthe youversion bible app is on million phones and is available in languages . backed to the tune of million by oklahoma city based life . church a megachurch that streams its services online , youversion features reading plans , goal setting abilities , and a built in social network . tam s k d r , a year old hungarian it consultant living in sweden , uses youversion to follow along in church and whenever i need to look up something , especially with different translations , in different languages . within the app , you can overlay bible verses on top of nature images and share the resulting meme with your twitter followers , facebook friends , or on the app s home feed . the youversion bible , also comes stocked with hundreds of reading plans , from the devotional to studies for the family to topical studies , like find purpose in your work . these plans often come at the result of partnerships with other apps or publishing houses , which can feel a little sponsored . for instance , the iphone game gun bros once featured youversion as an app that players could purchase to gain more in game currency . some christian apps have encountered serious problemssome christian apps have encountered serious problems instapray , the peter thiel backed app that allowed users to share their prayers with each other on their proprietary platform , sent an email out to members in october saying that they are no longer able to sustain the costs associated with running the app and asking members to subscribe to the instapray reading club for . a month . apps like idisciple charge their users a monthly fee for access to premium content . in this case , premium content means bible reading plans , shareable prayers , and teachings from well known christian leaders . many christian apps charge a fee to download . still , it s a hard market to succeed in financially . as amy keyishian wrote at recode earlier this year , it s next to impossible to monetize a prayer app . therefore , the only logical explanation for thiel s involvement is that it s a sort of tithing , or giving back to the community . it s next to impossible to monetize a prayer app . neil ahlsten worked in business development at google from , but left when he felt god calling him to put technology to use for the church at large . what if you assume that the bible contains insights into human behavior ? ahslten asked himself . can we design experiences around those behaviors that help people practice them better in modern life ? ahlsten and his team some of whom also came from google surveyed christians about their user experience of the bible , and found that the top problem modern day christians had was that they weren t sure how to pray . basically we re creating liturgy that people can consume whenever and wherever and however works for them , said ahlsten . abide provides users with daily prayers based on bible verses and the ability to set prayer reminders . the prayers themselves are accompanied by gentle background music , and cover topics like thankfulness , god s plans for you , and unity in love . in many ways developers of religious apps are no different from their secular counterparts . everyone is trying to take a desired habit in this case , prayer or scripture reading and make it more painless , easier , and more deliverable . the word frictionless pops up often . youversion will send you a gentle reminder if you haven t made much progress on the plan you selected , and give you a few helpful hints for keeping up . abide provides an array of recorded prayers users can listen to so that they can learn how to pray . the word frictionless pops up oftenevangelical christianity is very interested in cultural relevance . one of its flagship magazines is actually called relevant church services have been streaming online ever since the technology was made available pastors trumpet their love of u and sufjan stevens as badges of being with it . with the demise of christian separatist communities and the crumbling of the moral majority s denunciation of culture , christians are increasingly adapting to existing cultural norms , in this case , those of the tech sector . in a ampnbsp new yorker article , casey cep compared this phenomenon to a fitbit for the soul , and she s not wrong . in the quest to live quantified lives , we can set reminders for ourselves to exercise , eat well , and now , to pray . and it makes sense , if we think of the spiritual life as a discipline , that it could benefit from some of the same techniques that have reimagined the way people approach fitnessthe people behind many of these christian apps have set out to examine the ux of the spiritual life where are there bugs , and why do they happen ? what features are users missing ? how can we hack prayer ? quantifying spirituality makes some people understandably uncomfortable , and the latest technology will always have its skeptics . but it will also have its evangelists , and they re ready to share the good news . 	 if you were building a system to catalog and study the human face , it would be hard to do better than facebook . just years after its creation , the network is not just the largest photo storage service but the largest single collection of images that human beings have ever had access to . the total number of photos is hard to gauge , but it passed billion pictures in , and by now is likely closing in on trillion , spread across . billion users worldwide . that much data is a powerful thing , and facebook has made good use of it . since , the company has been using those photos to fuel a powerful facial recognition engine . when you upload a photo of someone , facebook will almost always know who that person is , encouraging you to tag them and let them know . thanks to the mountains of data , it s become one of the most advanced facial recognition systems available , far beyond the fbi s face scanning system . it s also a crucial product for facebook itself , integrated into the messenger app earlier this year . nearly trillion photos , spread across . billion users worldwidenow , a new lawsuit has called that system into question , claiming facebook s biometric faceprints violate user privacy . facebook disputes the claim , although it has avoided rolling out facial recognition in europe and canada , presumably over similar concerns . if the latest complaints are upheld , it could mean a profound shift in how facebook treats user photos , potentially even pushing the feature out of the us entirely . the case centers around the illinois biometric information privacy act , which deals with fingerprints , voiceprints , and scans of facial geometry . according to the law , anyone collecting those identifiers has to notify users in advance , say why they re being collected , and how long they re being retained . it also puts strict limits on how those identifiers can be shared and how long they can be stored . notably , photographs are explicitly ruled out as a biometric , but the plaintiffs argue the relevant biometric is the facial geometry scans created from those photographs . if facebook were a simple photo service , it wouldn t have to worry about biometrics at all but the plaintiffs argue that as long as the company is using those photos to create and apply faceprints , the illinois law applies . the key point isn t the collection of data , but using that data to create a profile specific to a person s body . alvaro bedoya , who has been following the case for the center on privacy and technology at georgetown law , described it this way if you run a bar , the law doesn t prevent you from picking up my used pint glass , but it prevents you from pulling my dna off it . the biggest question facing the court is whether facebook s photo tagging system crosses that line . the system is more complex than simply producing a scan from a photograph , relying heavily on known friends of the person uploading the photo . if a face doesn t belong to one of your friends , it won t be suggested as a tag . at the same time , the machine learning that powers the feature means matches are fuzzier than conventional biometrics , working off broad similarities rather than hard certainties . still , the net result is the same , reaching percent accuracy in a recent test . if you run a bar , the law doesn t prevent you from picking up my used pint glass , but it prevents you from pulling my dna off it . then there s the question of whether facebook has users consent to build that profile . there s nothing about facial recognition or biometric collection in facebook s terms of service . the company s data policy which users are also required to approve does refer to the system , saying tag suggestions are created by comparing your friend s pictures to information we ve put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you ve been tagged . users are also able to opt out of the system at any time , as described in the help center . somewhat confusingly , the option is nested in settings under the question who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded ? as long as the option is set to no one , facebook won t build a facial recognition profile for that user . neither the help center nor the settings page mention facial recognition or biometrics by name . they refer to the system simply as tag suggestions . even if the court agrees facebook s system violates the illinois law , it may not matter . last week , in a motion to dismiss the suit , facebook argued that the company was bound only by the state laws of california , as agreed to in the terms of service . if the court agrees , it would mean that plaintiffs have forfeited their rights under illinois law simply by signing up with the service . that would be a serious blow to state sovereignty effectively meaning illinois can t pass laws concerning its own citizens data privacy but courts have upheld similar clauses in the past . if the case survives the motion , facebook will have plenty more chances to dismiss the case before it reaches a final verdict . we will defend ourselves vigorously . but even if the case is dismissed , the issues are unlikely to disappear entirely . as biometric data like fingerprints and iris scans become more pervasive , more states are considering privacy laws like the one passed in illinois . texas already has a similar criminal statute although testing it would require a state attorney general to bring the company up on charges . alaska and washington have brought similar bills to the legislature , although neither one made it into law . if any of those laws do affect facebook , it won t be alone . google released a similar system in photos earlier this year , and facial recognition is quickly becoming a must have feature for photo storage systems , raising the stakes even higher . in theory , the problems could be solved by simply disclosing the recognition systems more aggressively , but it s unlikely either company would want to submit to the law s retention rules or any other policies that might be handed down in the future . either way , facebook isn t giving up the illinois case without a fight . this lawsuit is without merit , a spokesperson said in a statement , and we will defend ourselves vigorously . 	 the scene is a snowy apartment building out of the s , rendered in a bright , slightly retro palette . a janitor trudges across the courtyard , then stops , wary . someone is out there . someone large , nimble , and wearing a floppy red hat . then you turn your phone . the janitor slides away , and instead you re looking into the third floor window of a snoring tenant . move over a little more , and there s a cat eyeing a tiny bird on the rooftop . as you focus , the cat tries to pounce . another bird this one giant and angry plops down in front of it , and the cat scoots back across a line of christmas lights , chastened . and then we re back to the janitor , who starts a wild chase with a mysterious intruder who is , obviously , santa claus . this animated short called special delivery and released today is the latest project released for spotlight stories , a smartphone based video platform run by google s advanced technology and projects atap group . it s an interactive youtube video compatible with android phones , with a non interactive degree video version for ios or web users . a collaboration with uk studio aardman animations , the project is another small step towards turning a google experiment into a new artistic medium . spotlight stories started in with a one off video called windy day , created by ratatouille co director jan pinkava now spotlight stories creative director . instead of using a fixed camera , windy day asked viewers to pretend their phones were windows into a tiny , pixar esque world . they could choose to follow a mouse chasing his wayward hat , or they could soak in details from the scenery around him . it was the kind of video that could only be done with a smartphone s motion sensors , turning phones into more than little tvs . windy day debuted as a cute perk for moto x phone owners , but google quickly started thinking bigger . after the short was well received , atap started two new pieces , one of them in partnership with legendary disney animator glen keane . keane s creation , a hand drawn animation called duet , was nominated for both an annie award and an oscar . duet got us a lot of credibility within the artist community , that this is not a gimmick , this is not a sort of gamey thing that we re doing , says spotlight stories technical lead rachid el guerrab . this is actually real animation , just in a different way . this is actually real animation , just in a different way . since then , atap has been reaching out not just to the art community , but to hollywood and the world at large . it recruited furious director justin lin for the first live action short earlier this year , and it announced a story development kit , a toolbox for artists to create spotlight style animation or video on their own . we re trying to do more and figure out is this really a new form of entertainment ? says el guerrab . what are the ingredients in it that make it different from a normal film ? the creators of special delivery have a long pedigree in normal film aardman animations is behind among other things the film chicken run and the wallace and gromit animated shorts . when atap approached aardman with the story development kit , says director tim ruffle , they returned with a number of ideas that they thought would fit the medium . one of them stuck what if looking through the phone s imaginary window was more like peering into a literal one ? we kind of imagined what if rear window happened at christmas , and was trapped in your little phone in a degree world ? says ruffle . instead of following one or two characters , viewers could see snippets of life across an entire apartment block , blended with a single main storyline that would give the piece focus . it seemed so perfect for looking out into these little vignettes . aardman wasn t the first to pitch a rear window inspired spotlight short it s actually a pretty intuitive connection . but google liked the studio s vision of what pinkava calls a groovy period piece . its style was inspired by mid th century animation trailblazer upa , creator of both comedic characters like mr . magoo and surreal shorts like an adaptation of poe s the tell tale heart . aardman s animation , though , had to look good from several different possible camera angles . it couldn t be linear , and it had to progress at the viewer s pace . in special delivery , some vignettes only begin when you look closely at them , and major story events will wait until you re paying attention . instead of a screen , the team had to imagine something more like a stage . they even built a circular cardboard set as a storyboard , blocking out the movement of their characters in physical space . when you have that literal arm s length of looking through a window , you have many more options . you re giving away the camera to the audience , which is a bit nerve wracking , says ruffle . after a while , you kind of get the idea that you re trying to create an experience for people , rather than creating a show . that s a sentiment that s heard more and more often , from directors exploring the nascent field of virtual reality video . the natural progression for spotlight stories seems like a switch from holding a phone to wearing goggles of being in the world instead of seeing little pieces of it . windy day eventually got support for google s cardboard headset , and special delivery works in cardboard as well . but pinkava disputes the idea that spotlight stories is just a stepping stone towards vr . there s a difference to having a sense of being inside a world more literally , when you have vr goggles on your face , he says . but looking through a window also gives the maker of a story different options for what you can do . there s no need to worry about motion sickness , for example a major limiting factor in designing for vr . when you have that literal arm s length of looking through a window , you have many more options to kind of cheat , and do exciting and interesting tricks to tell a story . special delivery is supposed to work equally well with both . but when i try it out , i actually prefer the non cardboard version . cardboard focuses me totally on the scene , but because i have to turn with my head and not my comparatively super flexible hands , it feels as if i have less control over my view . i m distracted by the phone s low resolution in vr , which makes it harder to appreciate the crisp , stylish animation . and in a strange twist , cardboard feels more artificial . i ve spent so much time staring into screens that i ve nearly stopped noticing them , but cardboard is still a novelty that constantly reminds me of its presence especially because unlike other headsets , you have to actively hold it against your face . it s almost more technologically impressive that while the earlier spotlight stories were hefty downloads in a dedicated app , special delivery streams on youtube , making it far easier for casual viewers to check it out . google has spent the past two months playing up degree youtube videos , but special delivery s light interactive elements push it closer to something like a living environment . most of the scenes are available to you from the first moment you enter , says el guerrab . it s like downloading half of your movie in the beginning few seconds . it s like downloading half of your movie in the beginning few seconds . it s almost , i suggest , like youtube could become a basic game platform . el guerrab quickly shuts down the comparison . it s partly on technical grounds atap prides itself on making spotlight stories technical components as stripped down as possible , compared to a full featured game engine . but it s also a question of vision . the focus is on storytelling . it s a much bigger audience for us , for creators in general , he says . there s a different audience that is game developers . those distinctions , though , are blurring . el guerreb admits that there s an intersection between something like special delivery and the non traditional adventure games of telltale , and virtual reality has popularized semi interactive experiences without obvious game like elements . and while spotlight stories is still working closely with high profile artists like academy award winning animator patrick osborne , the team also hopes to release the story development kit publicly at some point next year , so creators can figure out its limits for themselves . we have at least enough material and support that we can say go create stuff with it , says el guerrab . that s our biggest push . 	 if early reports prove true , ford and google will announce the development of a self driving car initiative at the consumer electronics show in las vegas early next month , a mutually beneficial partnership that could provide a blueprint for the next shift in the transportation industry . yahoo autos reports that the two companies are creating an independent joint venture , a structure that protects google and ford from potential liability , to produce self driving cars . it s said to be part of a non exclusive deal , meaning that google could partner with other automakers as well . in recent weeks , both companies have been making news that could support this pending announcement . google has been reported to be creating an alphabet company to house its self driving car research . last week , ford received approval to test autonomous cars on public california roads , where google s efforts have been focused . what gives google an edge is that it isn t a car companygoogle s self driving car program on public roads has helped it carve out its reputation as the breakout leader in a transformational technology that will fundamentally reshape the way we get around in the decades to come . it s logged over million miles of self driving on public streets in california and texas . while google is not the first to pilot autonomous features , its silicon valley roots have helped foster the perception that it s poised to leave the legacy car industry titans behind . what gives google an edge is that it isn t a car company it s unencumbered by customer perception , dealer networks , and the politics that are indelible parts of the auto industry . google can essentially afford to play and experiment in this space , which is exactly what it s been doing for years . in doing so , it s been able to develop software without being bogged down by the brutal economic realities of the auto industry and a customer base that s wary of too much technology . but in reality , taking the next step in the car business is not so straightforward and ford has much to offer a company like google , if it wants to create a viable product based on its treasure trove of real world driving data . so far , self driving has been a research initiative for google with no demonstrative profit . google lacks the traditional auto industry infrastructure to manufacture cars at the same speed that it produces software and services . by working with ford , google gains complex manufacturing , quality , safety , and environmental regulation know how that dates back to henry ford s invention of the assembly line . while tesla s efforts to work outside the traditional dealer model have punished its ability to consistently sell cars everywhere that it wants to , ford s expansive dealer and sales networks are already in place . and ford is the second largest automaker in the us and the fifth largest in the world with manufacturing plants worldwide , its sheer potential for volume is a lucrative asset . it s also notable that both ford and google have already started expanding to each other s territories . while ford has opened a silicon valley research center in palo alto , google has expanded its detroit area offices this year as well , where ford , gm , and fiat chrysler are headquartered , along with many of the industry s tier one suppliers and universities that specialize in automotive research . nissan has kept its us research and development facilities headquarters in the area for this reason . before the report of the partnership broke , i spoke to michelle krebs , a senior analyst at autotrader , who essentially predicted the viability of this kind of pairing . the traditional automakers are clearly doing a lot of research and development and have been doing so for a long time on all kinds of electrification , autonomous features , and connectivity long before apple and google were interested , krebs said . but google and apple are clearly interested in now getting in the car business . i think what they are interested in ultimately is supplying what goes in the cars not getting into the whole car business of running plants and logistics around all that and dealing with regulatory issues and safety . the auto business is not a high margin business . the electronics business is a very high margin business . ford has much to offer a company like googleif the announcement does happen at ces , this partnership has probably been in the works for some time . car companies tend to keep a tight lid on advanced product development . last year , ford managed to unveil the new ford gt supercar at the north american international auto show without any substantive leaks . it took great pains to keep the development process under wraps , spearheaded by a small team of engineers and designers in a secret facility . like all the major car companies , ford has been testing autonomous technology for years and has the test facilities to do so far away from the public eye . yet too often what s dreamed up in the labs doesn t make it into production , thanks to regulatory concerns , cost , or technological constraints . ford and other automakers might be able to build autonomous cars , but could lack the fluid organizational structure necessary to integrate them across the product lineup , or to find the best business models for them . so what ford could gain from a company like google is the lean versatility to operate at the pace of a tech company , where development moves and iterates faster . and this partnership would be part of a running trend for ford it s been aggressive in recent years in its push to recast itself as tech leader , going back to its partnership with microsoft to introduce sync . while sync wasn t ultimately much further ahead than its competition , it marked a dramatic shift in the way ford presented itself . that shift continued earlier this year with the opening of ford s silicon valley office . and this year , it has steadily unveiled more tech initiatives , including last week s announcement that it s gearing up to increase its electrification efforts . it has also recently touted its partnership with techstars mobility in detroit , another effort to create a startup culture around transportation . ford also stands to gain by drawing in forward thinking players . it has touted the growth of its intellectual property and is keen to draw more talent to its ranks and above all else , get there first . this competition is classic detroit , dating back to the heyday of the big three brands , and what still fuels local pride . in recent years , some of the auto industry s most promising young talents have gone to tesla and faraday future , among other valley destinations . ford needs to invest in its perception to woo employees . of course , it also makes sense that google would also want to take this leap . former ford ceo alan mulally joined google s board last year . mulally , once an outsider from the aerospace industry , earned the respect of ford employees and is credited with turning the company into a financially healthy contender . he retired from ford in , but considering the wealth of knowledge about the industry that he built during his time there , it makes sense that he would be instrumental in putting this deal together . in addition , several former higher ranking ford employees including john krafcik , who now heads self driving for google . it s daunting to set up a car company , krebs said to me . that s the reason tesla is the only one who s done it recently . it s a hugely capital intensive business , where tech is not . automotive is a hugely capital intensive business , where tech is not . ford also recently announced a program to create a ride sharing business for its employees that could serve as a model for a tech partnership , while bloomberg reported that google could be considering ride sharing services in well defined areas , like college campuses . it seems like for the foreseeable future , small , contained environments are the low hanging fruit for self driving car fleets , and a fleet business would be a great place for a ford google joint venture to start . after all , before uber , the lincoln town car and the ford crown victoria were ubiquitous black cars and taxis . none of this is to say that ford is necessarily the only car company involved with google in the long term , it could take on a role that mirrors traditional auto industry suppliers like bosch , delphi , and most recently mobileye , which produce parts used in dozens of makes . maybe alphabet eventually wants to print its logo on cars made by ford , fiat , ferrari , and everyone in between . google s current self driving cars are already assembled by detroit mainstay roush industries , maker of custom ford mustangs . but at a moment when self driving hype is at a high , it certainly doesn t hurt ford to be first out of the gate .
